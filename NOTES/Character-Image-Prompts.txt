** Gemini is CRAZY for making enemy vectors!!!! HOWEVER... usage only resets every 24 hours, seem to have higher usage with personal account rather than a business...

    Then Pixelcut.ai seems to work SUPER well for removing background quickly, can only do 4 a day.
    Adobe Express background remover is also very very good.

⭐ 1. Tomb Guardian (Phase-Based Elite). ddd
A towering skeletal guardian clad in stone-etched burial armor, each phase revealing more cracks and more spirit-light leaking through the joints. Phase 1: fully armored, shield raised. Phase 2: armor splitting, inner ghostfire visible. Phase 3: armor falling away, revealing a radiant skeletal interior engraved with cryptic runes of forgotten duties. Its posture is mournful, as if it doesn’t want to fight. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 2. High Cultist Mira  ddd
A tall, emaciated priestess whose robes flow like ink toward a spiraling void sigil behind her head. Half her face retains the softness of a healer; the other half is smoothed into void geometry. Hands extended, summoning glyphs of the Hollow God. Thin strands of memory-light peel from her body as if being consumed. STYLE BASE.

ACT 1 — BOSS
⭐ The Bonelord ddd
A colossal mass of bones fused from countless fallen pilgrims, forming a regal yet monstrous silhouette. Three skulls form the “crown,” each representing a fragment of the knight he once was. Wears remnants of royal armor cracked and melted together across the bone mass. Ghostly blue fire leaks from ribcage cavities, symbolizing the memories he cannot let go of. His stance is heavy, tragic, and ceremonial—like a king defending a throne long forgotten. STYLE BASE.

ACT 2 — COMMON ENEMIES
⭐ 1. Slime ddd
A semi-translucent gelatinous mass with faint silhouettes of objects it absorbed—broken weapons, coins, a handprint fading inside it. Soft edges, cute-tragic rather than comedic. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 2. Slimeling ddd
A smaller, faster-shaped version of the slime with sharper silhouette, tiny drifting lights inside it representing swallowed memories. Slightly aggressive droplet-like shape. STYLE BASE.

A stone gargoyle animated by residual Sanctum magic, wings cracked, moss growing along joints. Eyes glow with soft inner sorrow. Pose suggests a guardian who failed centuries ago. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 6. Aberration (try again later)
A fused, tragic two-headed or two-silhouette creature whose bodies overlap as if pulled through each other. Arms mismatch in size, legs intertwine. Their facial expressions mirror grief and longing, reaching toward each other but unable to separate. Subtle embroidery or jewelry suggesting their former relationship. STYLE BASE.
 
⭐ 7. Drowned Cultist  dd
A cultist whose robes cling with water weight, seaweed wrapping their limbs, face pale and waterlogged. One eye normal, the other glossy and dead. Hands raised in silent underwater prayer. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 8. Deep One.  (try again later)
A once-human fisherman with fish-like scaling layered over skin, gills split along the ribs, and barnacles on shoulders. Holds a broken harpoon. Facial features warped but recognizably human—like someone who wanted to save their village. Wet silhouette with curved aquatic lines. STYLE BASE.

ACT 2 — ELITES
⭐ 1. Voidcaller. ddd
A tall, robed void-worshipper with a floating halo of spiraling runes. Their chest cavity glows with a small localized black hole pulling faint threads of reality inward. Hands outstretched in summoning gesture, calling forth tendrils of grief-void energy. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 2. Void Tendril ddd
A slim, shadowy tendril-being shaped like stretched sorrow. Long ribbon-like body with no defined head, glowing cracks running along its surface showing emotional fractures. Moves in spirals. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 3. Stone Sentinel ddd
A massive stone construct with runes carved deeply across chest and arms, lit with dim drowning-blue light. Joints are cracked from centuries underwater. Pose is protective, like it once guarded a king. STYLE BASE.

ACT 2 — BOSS
⭐ The Drowned King (Trident-wielding) ddd
A regal, drowned monarch with a broken crown fused to sea-soaked hair. Pale skin marbled with waterlogged veins. He holds a grand trident carved with symbols of Thalassar’s lost kingdom. Armor is ornate but rusted, encrusted with barnacles and coral. His expression flickers between stern kingly pride and crushing grief. Behind him, faint water sigils spiral upward like rising tides of memory. STYLE BASE.

ACT 3 — COMMON ENEMIES
⭐ 1. Imp (Gleeful Void-Demons) ddd
A small, twisted imp with angular limbs, manic grin, and tiny ember-like eyes. Its body is wiry and charred as though burnt by void energy, with little horns curling backward. Wings made of tattered shadow, fluttering like torn pages from forgotten memories. Gleeful, mischievous, delighted by destruction. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 2. Corrupted Angel   (try again)
A once-radiant angelic being whose wings are now split between feathers and dripping void strands. Face smooth on one side; the other distorted as if erased. Armor cracked open, leaking soft light that flickers like a dying candle. Halo fractured into segments orbiting chaotically. Pose expresses grief, not rage—an emissary betrayed by its own purpose. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 3. Void Spawn (try again)
A floating, amorphous creature shaped like a warped silhouette of a person you almost recognize. Its form tears inward toward a small gravity point—a memory-core that devours identity. Edges glitch, ripple, or blur like corrupted data. Eyes absent; face half-suggested. Trails of stolen memories spiral off its body in faint glowing ribbons. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 4. Sanctum Guardian ddd
A majestic but unsettling guardian construct carved from white stone and living crystal. Joints glow with Warden-light. Helmet has no face, only a vertical slit that emits a soft pulse. Its posture is noble, designed to protect—but cracks across the armor show a long struggle against the Hollow God’s corruption. Silhouette imposing, like a fallen paladin-statue made animate. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 5. Soul Fragment ddd
A fragile, humanoid outline formed of splintered soul-light, like shattered stained glass barely holding together. Limbs taper into drifting shards, as if the person is desperately trying to remember how to exist. Their face is soft and blurred, flickering with lost expressions. Barely hostile—more like a plea for wholeness. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 6. Infernal Hound ddd
A multi-headed infernal hound forged from void-fire and cracked obsidian plates. Three heads, each with different emotional expressions (rage, sorrow, hunger). Flames leak between the plates like molten memory. Tail ends in splintered bone spikes. Stance low and predatory but shaped like a creature that was once loyal to something. STYLE BASE.

ACT 3 — ELITES
⭐ 1. Arch Demon ddd
A towering archdemon with elongated horns shaped like branching roots of a dying world. Muscular but lean, skin etched with runes that pulse with void-light. Wings torn into jagged membranes. Mouth full of too many teeth forming spirals. Chains of broken contracts or vows dangle from wrists. Stands like a fallen general leading the last horrors of the Sanctum. STYLE BASE.

⭐ 2. Sanctum Warden ddd
A spectral knight-templar who appears as if carved from luminous crystal and cracked metal, representing a former Warden’s protective echo. Their armor is ornate but fractured, inner light spilling like sand from the cracks. Face hidden by a ceremonial helm engraved with forgotten names. Sword or spear made of hardened Warden-light. Their stance is unyielding, tragic, and noble—guarding the path to the Hollow God. STYLE BASE.

Act 3 - "Shadow Self"
Prompt:
A humanoid silhouette identical to the player's shape but rendered entirely in inverted colors and void-corrupted texture: translucent shadow body, hollow glowing eyes, glitching edges, spine bending unnaturally, subtle mirror of player's gear but simplified and distorted. Clean vector silhouette, no background.

ACT 3 — BOSS
⭐ The Hollow God
A towering, abstract figure shaped like the outline of a god but hollow inside—its entire body defined by absence. The silhouette is majestic, elegant, and terrifying: long limbs, regal stature, a presence carved from negative space. Inside the hollow form, threads of stolen memories swirl like pale ribbons, orbiting a singularity where a heart should be. The edges of the figure glitch, blur, and tear like corrupted data or unraveling consciousness. Its face is a smooth, vacant mask with faint, shifting impressions of dozens of half-remembered expressions flickering beneath it. A fractured crown made of broken identity shards orbits its head in jagged, uneven arcs. In its chest, a swirling void-core pulls inward, absorbing color and light. Thin tendrils of darkness drip downward like melted shadow, unraveling into nothing. Its posture is both regal and pitiful—reaching for identity but unable to grasp it. Composition emphasizes clean bold silhouette, high-detail interior textures, gothic-cosmic tragedy, memory-loss motifs, no background, transparent, vector illustration, game-ready boss art.

Hollow God Phase 2 --
Body more distorted, void-core brighter, identity shards swirling aggressively, limbs elongated, mask splitting into many shifting expressions.

Phase 3 -- 
Silhouette breaking apart into jagged negative-space fragments, void-core enormous and unstable, crown shattered into dozens of orbiting shards, posture desperate and reaching outward.

ACT 3 - SANCTUM CORE (arena)
A vast crystalline chamber lined with petrified Wardens encased in shimmering soul-crystal, each with engraved regrets. At the center is an empty formation of light—a space where the Hollow God “sits,” but nothing occupies it. Reality bends softly around the emptiness, subtle cracks of light forming spirals around the void. Vector, transparent, symbolic not literal.

===================================================

  1. CLERIC

  The Divine Healer
  Portrait of a battle-worn holy warrior standing in the ruins of a sacred cathedral,
  soft golden light emanating from their hands. They wear weathered white and gold vestments
  layered over light chain mail, bearing prayer scrolls at their belt. Their face shows
  serene determination, eyes glowing faintly with divine light. A halo of floating scripture
  pages orbits their head. The background shows crumbling stone walls with beams of
  heavenly light piercing through gaps. Style: dark fantasy, painterly, dramatic lighting,
  muted color palette with gold accents. Devotion mechanic represented by stacking golden
  rings of light around their forearms.

  ---
  2. DUNGEON KNIGHT
  The Unbreakable Bulwark

  Full-body portrait of a heavily armored knight standing resolute in a dark dungeon corridor,
  weathered tower shield planted firmly before them. Their scarred plate armor shows signs
  of countless battles - dented, scratched, but unbroken. Blue-grey steel with brass rivets,
  a closed greathelm with a narrow visor revealing only determined eyes. Stance is defensive,
  low and immovable. Shield glows with faint runic fortification magic. Background is rough-hewn
  stone walls with torch light flickering, casting dramatic shadows. Style: grimdark fantasy, sense of weight and permanence. Fortify mechanic shown as
  crystalline barrier patterns forming on armor.

  ---
  3. DIABOLIST
  The Cursed Bargainer

  Three-quarter portrait of a corrupted mage wreathed in crimson and black smoke,
  infernal contracts floating around them like burning parchment. Pale skin marked with
  glowing red contract sigils, eyes replaced with smoldering embers. They wear tattered
  dark robes with demonic iconography, one hand dripping with their own blood, the other
  clutching a soul-binding grimoire. Chains of hellfire wrap around their arms. Expression
  is cunning and pained - power at a terrible cost. Background: a hellscape bleeding into
  the dungeon, cracks revealing flames beneath. Style: dark fantasy, high contrast,
  reds and blacks dominating. Pain curse shown as thorny dark wisps entering their flesh.

  ---
  4. OATHSWORN
  The Bound Crusader

  Dynamic portrait of a holy warrior mid-stride, wrapped in glowing chains of their own
  sacred vows. They wear partial plate armor inscribed with oaths in celestial script,
  a long blade wreathed in white flame. Their face shows absolute conviction - jaw set,
  eyes blazing with inner fire. Golden chains of light connect their sword arm to an
  ethereal oath-seal floating above their shoulder. The chains bind as much as empower.
  Background: the edge of a sanctum being reclaimed from darkness, light vs shadow.
  Style: heroic fantasy with dark undertones, dramatic poses, dynamic lighting.
  Vow mechanic shown as luminous chains that both strengthen and restrict movement.

  ---
  5. FEY-TOUCHED
  The Chaotic Trickster

  Whimsical portrait of a mortal transformed by fey magic, features shifting between
  beautiful and unsettling. Pointed ears, one eye emerald green, the other violet with
  a cat's pupil. Their clothing is patchwork elegance - fine silks mixed with leaves
  and spider silk, mismatched patterns that somehow harmonize. Surrounded by floating
  motes of chaotic light, tiny mischievous spirits peeking from their pockets. Expression
  is impish, knowing, slightly unhinged. Background: a dungeon room where reality bends -
  mushrooms growing from stone, doorways leading to starfields. Style: fantastical,
  dreamlike quality, saturated colors against dark dungeon tones. Whimsy mechanic
  shown as dice-like runes flickering with random outcomes.

  ---
  6. CELESTIAL
  The Divine Conduit

  translucent with golden light bleeding through cracks in their skin like a vessel overfull.
  They wear simple white robes that flow unnaturally, as if underwater, with a crystalline
  breastplate reflecting light in rainbows. Wings of pure light manifest behind them -
  not physical, but suggested in the luminous pattern. Eyes are solid gold with no pupils.
  Expression is serene yet terrible - divine power barely contained. Background:
  sanctum ruins with pillars of light descending from above. Style: high fantasy,
  luminous, ethereal, warm gold and white palette. Radiance mechanic shown as

  binding runes. Their hands are adorned with spirit-anchor rings on every finger,
  one hand extended commanding their creatures. Face is gaunt and focused, eyes
  white and distant, seeing into the spirit realm. Background: a dungeon chamber
  where the veil between worlds is thin - ghostly shapes emerging from walls.

  accents. Minion mechanic shown as glowing tethers connecting summoner to creatures.

  ---
  8. BARGAINER
  The Debt Collector

  Sinister portrait of a merchant of souls, standing amid floating contracts and ledgers
  written in blood. They wear fine but corrupted attire - a once-elegant coat now stained
  with otherworldly ink, a vest with buttons made of small skulls. Their head is a demon's skull and is
  too wide, teeth slightly too sharp, eyes calculating the worth of everything they see.
  One hand holds a quill that drips with liquid shadow, the other gestures to a
  floating scale weighing souls against golden coins. Behind them, shadowy figures
  of those who couldn't pay their debts. Style: dark fantasy, gothic horror elements,
  rich textures, gold and crimson against deep blacks. Price/Favor mechanic shown as
  demonic contract seals burning on their skin and a spectral ledger always open.

  9. TIDECALLER 
  The Tidal Executor - (Water-aligned finisher class — “Drown” low-HP enemies, gains gold)

  PROMPT:
  A full-body portrait of a drowned-but-reborn tide priest who commands crushing water pressure like an executioner’s blade. Their armor is a hybrid of rusted pilgrim gear and smooth tide-worn plating, etched with spiraling marine runes. Water constantly drips from their form, collecting into floating rings around their wrists and ankles. Their eyes glow with deep-ocean blue—calm, cold, and judging. One hand shapes a hovering orb of compressed water (their finishing “Drown” spell); inside it, faint silhouettes of coins swirl like captured spoils. The other hand holds a barnacle-encrusted sickle or tide-hook used to drag prey into the depths.
  Their stance is upright, stoic, reminiscent of someone once sworn to rescue sailors—but now condemning those too weak to continue. Background: fractured sanctum walls with water pouring through impossible seams. Palette: deep blues, drowned turquoise, silver, hints of rusted metal. Lighting: moody, aquatic refractions.
  Mechanic Visualization:  Floating water sigils orbiting like tidal halos; coins or treasure fragments trapped within water spheres.

    Rear-view third-person camera angle behind the Tidecaller.
    Third-person over-the-shoulder from behind the player character, player shown only as a partial blurred silhouette from the back (shoulders/head), camera positioned slightly above and behind the player, clean vector silhouette, no background, no floor, transparent background.

  10. SHADOW STALKER
  The Void-Threaded Assassin

  PROMPT:
  A full-body portrait of a cloaked, razor-thin assassin whose body flickers between solid form and dissolving shadow. Their silhouette is sharp yet unstable—edges glitching, parts of limbs phasing out as if selectively erased by the void. They wear tight, muted leathers with arcane seams glowing faint violet; a hood obscures most features except two piercing, ghostlike eyes.
  Twin void-blades curve from their forearms, shaped from collapsed light—black steel veined with faint starlit cracks. Tiny motes of darkness fall from their steps like soot drifting upward. Background: a dungeon corridor where torches bend into warped shadows around them, as if dimmed by their presence. Palette: charcoal black, void purple, faint indigo, low saturation with sharp specular highlights.
  Their posture is predatory but mournful—like a hunter who gave up their identity to track what others could not.
  Mechanic Visualization:  Glitching afterimages echo behind their movement; faint tether-lines of shadow connecting the assassin to distant “kill marks.”

  Rear-view third-person camera angle behind the Shadow Stalker.
  Third-person over-the-shoulder from behind the player character, player shown only as a partial blurred silhouette from the back (shoulders/head), camera positioned slightly above and behind the player, clean vector silhouette, no background, no floor, transparent background.

  11. GOBLIN
  The Cheeky Scrapmonger -  (Secret class)

  PROMPT:
  A full-body portrait of a small, wiry goblin scavenger with a toothy, mischievous grin and oversized ears that curl like torn parchment. Their gear is an absurd mix of stolen relics, dungeon junk, and makeshift armor: a breastplate that’s clearly a repurposed pot, a shield made from a broken sanctum tablet, mismatched straps and charms jangling everywhere.
  They hold a “weapon” that is either a jury-rigged gadget—like a crossbow made from dungeon hinges—or a hilariously oversized wrench decorated with glowing runes they definitely do not understand. Their eyes shine with clever mischief; posture is leaning forward, ready to snatch loot the moment a foe dies.
  Background: piles of dungeon debris, faintly glowing runes on random objects they’ve jammed into their satchel. Palette: dungeon bronze, moss green, rusted red, bright highlights of stolen magical energy.
  Character Tone: Lightly comedic, but still within the dark-fantasy setting—like a creature surviving through wit, chaos, and shameless theft.
  Mechanic Visualization: A floating scrap-sigil made of knives, gears, small relics, and coins orbiting around them—implying “loot synergy.”

  Rear-View Third-Person Variant (Player-Camera Prompt):
  Rear-view third-person camera angle behind the Goblin.
  Third-person over-the-shoulder from behind the player character, player shown only as a partial blurred silhouette from the back (shoulders/head), camera positioned slightly above and behind the player, clean vector silhouette, no background, no floor, transparent background.
