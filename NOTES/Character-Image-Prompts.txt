1. CLERIC

  The Divine Healer

  Portrait of a battle-worn holy warrior standing in the ruins of a sacred cathedral,
  soft golden light emanating from their hands. They wear weathered white and gold vestments
  layered over light chain mail, bearing prayer scrolls at their belt. Their face shows
  serene determination, eyes glowing faintly with divine light. A halo of floating scripture
  pages orbits their head. The background shows crumbling stone walls with beams of
  heavenly light piercing through gaps. Style: dark fantasy, painterly, dramatic lighting,
  muted color palette with gold accents. Devotion mechanic represented by stacking golden
  rings of light around their forearms.

  2. DUNGEON KNIGHT

  The Unbreakable Bulwark

  Full-body portrait of a heavily armored knight standing resolute in a dark dungeon corridor,
  weathered tower shield planted firmly before them. Their scarred plate armor shows signs
  of countless battles - dented, scratched, but unbroken. Blue-grey steel with brass rivets,
  a closed greathelm with a narrow visor revealing only determined eyes. Stance is defensive,
  low and immovable. Shield glows with faint runic fortification magic. Background is rough-hewn
  stone walls with torch light flickering, casting dramatic shadows. Style: grimdark fantasy,
  realistic metal textures, sense of weight and permanence. Fortify mechanic shown as
  crystalline barrier patterns forming on armor.

  3. DIABOLIST

  The Cursed Bargainer

  Three-quarter portrait of a corrupted mage wreathed in crimson and black smoke,
  infernal contracts floating around them like burning parchment. Pale skin marked with
  glowing red contract sigils, eyes replaced with smoldering embers. They wear tattered
  dark robes with demonic iconography, one hand dripping with their own blood, the other
  clutching a soul-binding grimoire. Chains of hellfire wrap around their arms. Expression
  is cunning and pained - power at a terrible cost. Background: a hellscape bleeding into
  the dungeon, cracks revealing flames beneath. Style: dark fantasy, high contrast,
  reds and blacks dominating. Pain curse shown as thorny dark wisps entering their flesh.

  4. OATHSWORN

  The Bound Crusader

  Dynamic portrait of a holy warrior mid-stride, wrapped in glowing chains of their own
  sacred vows. They wear partial plate armor inscribed with oaths in celestial script,
  a long blade wreathed in white flame. Their face shows absolute conviction - jaw set,
  eyes blazing with inner fire. Golden chains of light connect their sword arm to an
  ethereal oath-seal floating above their shoulder. The chains bind as much as empower.
  Background: the edge of a sanctum being reclaimed from darkness, light vs shadow.
  Style: heroic fantasy with dark undertones, dramatic poses, dynamic lighting.
  Vow mechanic shown as luminous chains that both strengthen and restrict movement.

  5. FEY-TOUCHED

  The Chaotic Trickster

  Whimsical portrait of a mortal transformed by fey magic, features shifting between
  beautiful and unsettling. Pointed ears, one eye emerald green, the other violet with
  a cat's pupil. Their clothing is patchwork elegance - fine silks mixed with leaves
  and spider silk, mismatched patterns that somehow harmonize. Surrounded by floating
  motes of chaotic light, tiny mischievous spirits peeking from their pockets. Expression
  is impish, knowing, slightly unhinged. Background: a dungeon room where reality bends -
  mushrooms growing from stone, doorways leading to starfields. Style: fantastical,
  dreamlike quality, saturated colors against dark dungeon tones. Whimsy mechanic
  shown as dice-like runes flickering with random outcomes.

  6. CELESTIAL

  The Divine Conduit

  Ethereal portrait of a being channeling pure radiant energy, their mortal form partially
  translucent with golden light bleeding through cracks in their skin like a vessel overfull.
  They wear simple white robes that flow unnaturally, as if underwater, with a crystalline
  breastplate reflecting light in rainbows. Wings of pure light manifest behind them -
  not physical, but suggested in the luminous pattern. Eyes are solid gold with no pupils.
  Expression is serene yet terrible - divine power barely contained. Background:
  sanctum ruins with pillars of light descending from above. Style: high fantasy,
  luminous, ethereal, warm gold and white palette. Radiance mechanic shown as
  stacking halos of increasing intensity.

  7. SUMMONER

  The Spirit Caller

  Atmospheric portrait of a mystic surrounded by ghostly minions - a wisp floating at
  their shoulder, a spirit wolf at their heels, ethereal guardians circling overhead.
  They wear layered robes of deep purple and silver, covered in summoning circles and
  binding runes. Their hands are adorned with spirit-anchor rings on every finger,
  one hand extended commanding their creatures. Face is gaunt and focused, eyes
  white and distant, seeing into the spirit realm. Background: a dungeon chamber
  where the veil between worlds is thin - ghostly shapes emerging from walls.
  Style: dark fantasy, ethereal lighting, spectral blues and purples with silver
  accents. Minion mechanic shown as glowing tethers connecting summoner to creatures.

  8. BARGAINER

  The Debt Collector

  Sinister portrait of a merchant of souls, standing amid floating contracts and ledgers
  written in blood. They wear fine but corrupted attire - a once-elegant coat now stained
  with otherworldly ink, a vest with buttons made of small skulls. Their smile is
  too wide, teeth slightly too sharp, eyes calculating the worth of everything they see.
  One hand holds a quill that drips with liquid shadow, the other gestures to a
  floating scale weighing souls against golden coins. Behind them, shadowy figures
  of those who couldn't pay their debts. Style: dark fantasy, gothic horror elements,
  rich textures, gold and crimson against deep blacks. Price/Favor mechanic shown as
  demonic contract seals burning on their skin and a spectral ledger always open.
