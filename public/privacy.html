  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: December 5, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Sanctum Ruins ("the Game"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you play our roguelike deck-builder game.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> We collect minimal data, store your game progress locally on your device, and never sell your information. If you create an optional account, we store only what's needed for cloud saves.
  </div>

  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game Progress</strong>: Your save data, unlocked content, achievements, and settings are stored locally on your device. If you create an account, this data is optionally synced to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics (Optional)</strong>: We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data to improve the game (e.g., which classes are most popular, average run length). This data cannot identify you personally.</li>
    <li><strong>Error Reports</strong>: If the game crashes, anonymous error information may be sent to help us fix bugs.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>To fix bugs and improve stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>Your game progress is primarily stored locally on your device using standard browser storage (localStorage). If you create an account, a backup is stored on our secure servers hosted by Heroku. We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transmission.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
