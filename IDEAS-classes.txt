Thematic Angles
Option 1: Planar Wanderers

You're traversing dying planes of existence, collecting echoes of power
Classes: Voidcaller (summons entities from between planes), Chronarch (time manipulation), Soulweaver (life/death transfer)
Resource: Aether (cosmic energy)
Status effects: Phased (dodge next attack), Entropy (hp decay), Temporal Lock, Void-touched
Cards represent fragments of reality you're stitching together

Option 2: Pact Magic/Demon Bargaining

You've made pacts with otherworldly entities, building power through deals
Classes: Diabolist (infernal pacts), Fey-bound (nature/trickery), Celestial Channeler (divine/radiant)
Resource: Favor or Essence
Unique mechanic: Cards have costs AND prices (immediate cost vs long-term consequence)
Status effects: Indebted, Blessed, Cursed, Marked, Enraptured
Riffs on Faustian bargains - power now, suffering later (or clever ways to dodge it)

Option 3: Elemental Dominion

Four primal forces in conflict, you're channeling their raw power
Classes: Flameheart (fire/passion), Tidecaller (water/adaptation), Earthshaper (stone/endurance), Stormkin (air/chaos)
Resource: Mana with elemental attunement
Mechanic: Cards have elemental alignments, chaining same element = bonuses, mixing elements = different effects
Status effects: Burning, Drenched, Petrified, Conducting, Resonance

Option 4: Grimoire Mages

You're a mage with a sentient spellbook, learning forbidden magic
Classes: Blood Scribe (sacrifice HP for power), Runesmith (rune combos), Wild Scholer (chaos magic), Necroscribe (undead/curses)
Resource: Ink or Mana
Mechanic: Cards can be "annotated" during run (add notes that modify effects)
Your deck IS your grimoire literally
Status effects: Hemorrhaging, Inscribed, Maddened, Hex-marked, Transcribed

Option 5: Dungeon Delvers in a Living Dungeon

The dungeon itself is a entity, rooms shift, it's testing you
Classes: Tomb Raider (traps/tools), Dungeon Knight (defensive juggernaut), Shadow Stalker (stealth/ambush), Lorekeeper (knowledge/preparation)
Resource: Stamina or Resolve
Mechanic: Environmental cards shuffle into your deck based on room type
Status effects: Exhausted, Prepared, Trapped, Hidden, Illuminated

My Recommendation: Pact Magic (Option 2)
Here's why it works:
The Hook
Every card represents a pact or deal. Playing cards might have deferred costs - maybe "Infernal Strength" gives you +3 strength this combat but adds a Curse card to your deck, or "Fey Bargain" draws 3 cards but you take 2 damage at the start of next turn.
Classes (Revised)
The Diabolist

Makes deals with devils for raw power
Starter deck focuses on high-impact cards with drawbacks
Mechanic: Contracts - some powers last until you fulfill a condition
Example: "Deal with the Pit Lord" - +2 Strength until you fall below 50% HP

The Oathbound

Bound by celestial vows, righteous but rigid
Starter deck has cards that work in sequences (Vow → Judgment → Absolution chains)
Mechanic: Oaths - powerful effects but locks you into playing certain card types
Example: "Oath of Valor" - Next 3 attack cards deal double damage, but you can't defend

The Fey-Touched

Deals with capricious fey entities, trickery and chaos
Starter deck has random effects and card manipulation
Mechanic: Whimsy - cards have multiple possible outcomes
Example: "Pixie's Gift" - Draw 2 cards OR gain 8 block OR deal 6 damage (chosen randomly)

Resource: Essence (3 per turn base)
More mystical than mana, represents your soul's capacity for bargaining
Status Effects (Renamed)

Indebted: Take X damage at end of combat (replaces Poison concept)
Blessed: Heal X at end of turn
Hexed: Deal 25% less damage (replaces Weak)
Exposed: Take 50% more damage (replaces Vulnerable)
Bound: Cannot play certain card types
Empowered: Increase effectiveness of next card
Marked: Enemy focuses you, can't gain block from cards

Unique Mechanics

Bargain cards: High power but add negative cards to deck
Pact tokens: Accumulate through run, spend for powerful relics at special nodes
Soul weight: Some cards cost HP instead of Essence
