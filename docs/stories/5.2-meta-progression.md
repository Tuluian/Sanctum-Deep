# Story 5.2: Meta-Progression System (Soul Echoes)

## Dev Notes

### Upgrade Philosophy

Meta-progression should:
1. **Feel rewarding** - Each unlock provides noticeable benefit
2. **Not trivialize the game** - Bonuses are small but meaningful
3. **Encourage experimentation** - Different builds suit different upgrades
4. **Respect player time** - Full unlock takes ~50 hours, not 500

### Upgrade Data Structure

```typescript
// src/types/upgrades.ts
export interface Upgrade {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  cost: number;
  path: 'vitality' | 'resolve' | 'combat' | 'fortune' | 'class';
  classId?: CharacterClassId; // Only for class upgrades
  prerequisites: string[]; // Upgrade IDs required
  effect: UpgradeEffect;
  tier: 1 | 2 | 3; // Visual positioning in tree
}

export type UpgradeEffect =
  | { type: 'max_hp'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'starting_resolve'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'starting_gold'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'starting_block'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'damage_bonus'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'block_bonus'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'card_reward_count'; amount: number }
  | { type: 'gold_multiplier'; percent: number }
  | { type: 'starting_relic'; rarity: 'common' }
  | { type: 'starting_potion'; potionId: string }
  | { type: 'merchant_discount'; percent: number }
  | { type: 'crit_chance'; percent: number }
  | { type: 'class_specific'; classId: CharacterClassId; effect: ClassUpgradeEffect };
```

### Upgrade Definitions

```typescript
// src/data/upgrades.ts
export const UPGRADES: Upgrade[] = [
  // Vitality Path
  {
    id: 'iron_constitution_1',
    name: 'Iron Constitution I',
    description: '+3 max HP',
    cost: 50,
    path: 'vitality',
    prerequisites: [],
    effect: { type: 'max_hp', amount: 3 },
    tier: 1,
  },
  {
    id: 'iron_constitution_2',
    name: 'Iron Constitution II',
    description: '+5 max HP',
    cost: 100,
    path: 'vitality',
    prerequisites: ['iron_constitution_1'],
    effect: { type: 'max_hp', amount: 5 },
    tier: 2,
  },
  {
    id: 'deaths_door',
    name: "Death's Door",
    description: 'First fatal hit per run leaves you at 1 HP instead.',
    cost: 400,
    path: 'vitality',
    prerequisites: ['iron_constitution_2'],
    effect: { type: 'deaths_door' },
    tier: 3,
  },

  // Class - Cleric
  {
    id: 'cleric_faithful_start',
    name: 'Faithful Start',
    description: 'Start combats with 2 Devotion.',
    cost: 100,
    path: 'class',
    classId: CharacterClassId.CLERIC,
    prerequisites: [],
    effect: { type: 'class_specific', classId: CharacterClassId.CLERIC,
      effect: { type: 'starting_devotion', amount: 2 } },
    tier: 1,
  },
];
```

### Upgrade Service

```typescript
// src/services/UpgradeService.ts
export class UpgradeService {
  private purchasedUpgrades: Set<string>;
  private totalSoulEchoesSpent: number = 0;

  constructor() {
    this.loadFromStorage();
  }

  canPurchase(upgradeId: string): { canBuy: boolean; reason?: string } {
    const upgrade = getUpgradeById(upgradeId);
    if (!upgrade) return { canBuy: false, reason: 'Upgrade not found' };

    if (this.purchasedUpgrades.has(upgradeId)) {
      return { canBuy: false, reason: 'Already purchased' };
    }

    const soulEchoes = this.getSoulEchoes();
    if (soulEchoes < upgrade.cost) {
      return { canBuy: false, reason: 'Not enough Soul Echoes' };
    }

    for (const prereq of upgrade.prerequisites) {
      if (!this.purchasedUpgrades.has(prereq)) {
        return { canBuy: false, reason: `Requires: ${getUpgradeById(prereq)?.name}` };
      }
    }

    return { canBuy: true };
  }

  purchase(upgradeId: string): boolean {
    const { canBuy } = this.canPurchase(upgradeId);
    if (!canBuy) return false;

    const upgrade = getUpgradeById(upgradeId)!;
    this.deductSoulEchoes(upgrade.cost);
    this.purchasedUpgrades.add(upgradeId);
    this.totalSoulEchoesSpent += upgrade.cost;
    this.saveToStorage();

    return true;
  }

  respec(): number {
    const refund = Math.floor(this.totalSoulEchoesSpent * 0.5);
    this.purchasedUpgrades.clear();
    this.totalSoulEchoesSpent = 0;
    this.addSoulEchoes(refund);
    this.saveToStorage();
    return refund;
  }

  getActiveUpgrades(classId?: CharacterClassId): Upgrade[] {
    return Array.from(this.purchasedUpgrades)
      .map(id => getUpgradeById(id))
      .filter(u => u && (!u.classId || u.classId === classId)) as Upgrade[];
  }

  // Apply all effects at run start
  applyToRunState(runState: RunState): void {
    const upgrades = this.getActiveUpgrades(runState.classId);

    for (const upgrade of upgrades) {
      switch (upgrade.effect.type) {
        case 'max_hp':
          runState.maxHp += upgrade.effect.amount;
          runState.currentHp += upgrade.effect.amount;
          break;
        case 'starting_gold':
          runState.gold += upgrade.effect.amount;
          break;
        case 'starting_relic':
          const relic = getRandomRelic(upgrade.effect.rarity);
          runState.relics.push(relic);
          break;
        // ... etc
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Applying Effects During Combat

```typescript
// In CombatEngine or wrapper
function applyUpgradesToCombat(upgrades: Upgrade[]): void {
  for (const upgrade of upgrades) {
    switch (upgrade.effect.type) {
      case 'starting_block':
        this.state.player.block += upgrade.effect.amount;
        break;
      case 'damage_bonus':
        this.damageBonus += upgrade.effect.amount;
        break;
      case 'class_specific':
        this.applyClassUpgrade(upgrade.effect);
        break;
    }
  }
}

// In damage calculation
function calculateDamage(baseDamage: number): number {
  let damage = baseDamage + this.damageBonus;

  if (this.hasUpgrade('critical_training')) {
    if (Math.random() < 0.05) {
      damage *= 2;
      this.addCombatLog('Critical hit!');
    }
  }

  return damage;
}
```

### Balance Notes

**Total Soul Echoes to unlock everything:**
- Vitality (6 upgrades): ~1,150 SE
- Resolve (6 upgrades): ~825 SE
- Combat (6 upgrades): ~1,000 SE
- Fortune (6 upgrades): ~975 SE
- Per Class (3 upgrades × 5): ~2,250 SE
- **Total: ~6,200 SE**

With ~1,750 SE available from achievements, players need ~4,450 SE from runs.
At ~50 SE per winning run, that's ~90 wins for full unlock (dedicated players).

**Power Budget:**
- Max bonus HP: +15 (20% increase for 75 HP class)
- Max damage bonus: +1 (small but consistent)
- Max starting Resolve: +2 (significant early game boost)

## Testing

### Test File Location
`src/services/UpgradeService.test.ts`

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Purchase**: Correct SE deduction, upgrade added
2. **Prerequisites**: Can't buy without prereqs
3. **Insufficient Funds**: Can't buy without enough SE
4. **No Duplicates**: Can't buy same upgrade twice
5. **Effect Application**: Stats correctly modified at run start
6. **Respec**: Correct refund amount, all upgrades cleared
7. **Class Filtering**: Class upgrades only apply to that class
