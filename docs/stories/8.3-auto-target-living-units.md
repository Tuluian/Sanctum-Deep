# Story 8.3: Auto-Target Living Units Only

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** player using attack cards,
**I want** to automatically target only living enemies,
**so that** I don't waste attacks on dead enemies or have to manually manage targeting.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Attack cards auto-target living enemies only (HP > 0)
2. Dead enemies are removed from the battlefield immediately on death
3. If current target dies, auto-select next living enemy
4. Multi-target attacks skip dead enemies
5. Player cannot manually select dead enemies
6. Combat proceeds smoothly without dead enemy bodies lingering

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update targeting logic (AC: 1, 3, 5)
  - [x] Filter target list to living enemies only (already implemented in UI)
  - [x] Auto-advance target on current target death
  - [x] Prevent manual selection of dead enemies (already implemented)
- [x] Implement autoSelectLivingTarget helper
- [ ] Implement dead enemy removal (AC: 2, 6) - DESIGN DECISION: Keep dead enemies in array
- [ ] Update multi-target attacks (AC: 4) - Already implemented
- [ ] Update UI (AC: 2, 6) - Dead enemies already styled differently

## Dev Notes

### Implementation

Added `autoSelectLivingTarget()` method to main.ts that:
1. Checks if current selected target is dead or doesn't exist
2. Finds the first living enemy (HP > 0)
3. Sets the renderer's selected enemy to that index

This method is called:
- After every card play
- After every enemy turn ends

### Pre-existing Safeguards

The codebase already had several safeguards:
1. **CombatEngine.ts line 474**: `playCard()` validates target is alive before allowing card play
2. **main.ts line 206**: `setEnemyClickHandler` only allows selecting enemies with HP > 0
3. **renderer.ts line 306**: Dead enemies rendered with 'dead' class, not selectable styling

### Design Decision

The story mentioned removing dead enemies from the array. However, the current implementation keeps dead enemies in the array with `currentHp <= 0`. This is intentional because:
1. Resurrection abilities need to reference dead minions
2. Death tracking for achievements needs the enemy data
3. The UI already hides/dims dead enemies appropriately

### File Changes
- `src/main.ts` - Added `autoSelectLivingTarget()` method, called after card plays and turn ends
