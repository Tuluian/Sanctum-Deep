## Dev Notes

### Radiance Mechanic

**Radiance** is a stackable divine energy resource unique to the Celestial class:
- Gained primarily through Blessing cards and certain divine spells
- Stacks up to 10, persists between turns
- Can be consumed for powerful burst effects
- At max stacks (10), grants Divine Form buff

### Divine Form

When Radiance reaches 10:
- Player gains DIVINE_FORM status effect
- All attack cards deal +1 additional damage
- Visual indicator shows divine transformation
- Consuming Radiance below 10 removes Divine Form

### Card Definitions

```typescript
const CELESTIAL_CARDS = {
  holy_bolt: {
    id: 'holy_bolt',
    name: 'Holy Bolt',
    type: CardType.ATTACK,
    cost: 1,
    description: 'Deal 5 damage.',
    effects: [{ type: EffectType.DAMAGE, amount: 5 }],
    classId: CharacterClassId.CELESTIAL
  },
  divine_shield: {
    id: 'divine_shield',
    name: 'Divine Shield',
    type: CardType.SKILL,
    cost: 1,
    description: 'Gain 5 block.',
    effects: [{ type: EffectType.BLOCK, amount: 5 }],
    classId: CharacterClassId.CELESTIAL
  },
  blessing: {
    id: 'blessing',
    name: 'Blessing',
    type: CardType.SKILL,
    cost: 1,
    description: 'Gain 1 Radiance.',
    effects: [{ type: EffectType.GAIN_RADIANCE, amount: 1 }],
    classId: CharacterClassId.CELESTIAL
  },
  smite_the_wicked: {
    id: 'smite_the_wicked',
    name: 'Smite the Wicked',
    type: CardType.ATTACK,
    cost: 2,
    description: 'Deal 8 damage. Consume all Radiance to deal +4 damage per stack.',
    effects: [
      { type: EffectType.DAMAGE, amount: 8 },
      { type: EffectType.CONSUME_RADIANCE_DAMAGE, perStack: 4 }
    ],
    classId: CharacterClassId.CELESTIAL
  }
};
```

### Radiance Implementation

```typescript
// In PlayerState interface
interface PlayerState {
  // ... existing properties
  radiance: number;
}

// Radiance effect handling
function handleGainRadiance(amount: number): void {
  const MAX_RADIANCE = 10;
  const previousRadiance = player.radiance;
  player.radiance = Math.min(player.radiance + amount, MAX_RADIANCE);

  // Check for Divine Form activation
  if (previousRadiance < MAX_RADIANCE && player.radiance >= MAX_RADIANCE) {
    applyStatusEffect(player, 'DIVINE_FORM', 1);
  }

  emitEvent('PLAYER_RADIANCE_CHANGED', { radiance: player.radiance });
}

function handleConsumeRadianceDamage(baseDamage: number, perStack: number, target: Enemy): void {
  const bonusDamage = player.radiance * perStack;
  const totalDamage = baseDamage + bonusDamage;

  // Remove Divine Form if active
  if (player.radiance >= 10) {
    removeStatusEffect(player, 'DIVINE_FORM');
  }

  player.radiance = 0;
  dealDamageToEnemy(target, totalDamage);
  emitEvent('PLAYER_RADIANCE_CHANGED', { radiance: 0 });
}
```

  engine/
    CombatEngine.ts   - Add Radiance effect handling
  types/
    index.ts          - Add CELESTIAL to CharacterClassId, add radiance to PlayerState
  ui/
    renderer.ts       - Add Radiance display and Divine Form indicator
```

## Testing

### Test File Location
`src/tests/classes/Celestial.test.ts`

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Class Stats**: Celestial has 70 HP and 3 Resolve
2. **Deck Composition**: 4 Holy Bolt, 3 Divine Shield, 2 Blessing, 1 Smite the Wicked
3. **Radiance Persistence**: Radiance remains after endTurn()
4. **Radiance Cap**: Gaining 5 Radiance when at 8 results in 10 (capped)
5. **Divine Form Activation**: At exactly 10 Radiance, Divine Form activates
6. **Divine Form Damage Bonus**: Attack deals +1 damage while Divine Form active
7. **Smite Consumption**: Smite the Wicked with 5 Radiance deals 8 + (5 * 4) = 28 damage
