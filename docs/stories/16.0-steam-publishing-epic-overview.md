# Epic 16: Steam Publishing

## Status: Draft (Future)

## Overview

This epic covers publishing Sanctum Ruins on Steam. This involves wrapping the web game in a desktop application (Electron or Tauri), integrating Steamworks SDK, and meeting Steam's publishing requirements.

## Goals

1. **Desktop Wrapper**: Package web game as native Windows/macOS/Linux app
2. **Steam Integration**: Achievements, cloud saves, overlay
3. **Store Presence**: Page, screenshots, trailers, descriptions
4. **Launch & Marketing**: Wishlists, launch discount, press

## Stories

| Story | Title | Complexity | Offline-Friendly |
|-------|-------|------------|------------------|
| 16.1 | Desktop Wrapper (Electron/Tauri) | Medium | Yes |
| 16.2 | Steamworks SDK Integration | High | Partial |
| 16.3 | Steam Achievements | Medium | Yes |
| 16.4 | Steam Cloud Saves | Medium | Yes |
| 16.5 | Store Page Assets | Medium | Yes |
| 16.6 | Steam Submission & Review | Low | No |

## Prerequisites

- Steam Developer Account ($100 one-time fee)
- Completed and polished game
- Legal entity or individual tax information
- Bank account for payments

## Technology Decision: Electron vs Tauri

### Option A: Electron
**Pros:**
- Battle-tested, widely used
- Same Chromium engine as browsers
- Large ecosystem of plugins
- Easy to set up

**Cons:**
- Large bundle size (~150MB+)
- Higher memory usage
- Requires Node.js runtime

### Option B: Tauri
**Pros:**
- Much smaller bundle (~10-20MB)
- Better performance
- Uses system webview
- Rust-based (more secure)

**Cons:**
- Newer, less mature
- Webview behavior varies by OS
- Smaller community

**Recommendation**: Start with **Electron** for reliability, consider Tauri for v2.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Game runs as standalone desktop app
- [ ] Steam achievements unlock correctly
- [ ] Cloud saves sync between devices
- [ ] Store page approved and live
- [ ] Successfully passes Steam review

## Dependencies

- Epic 15: Web Publishing (game must be polished)
- iOS publishing not required but parallel work possible
