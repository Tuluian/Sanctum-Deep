# Achievement Flavor Text Guide

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** player unlocking achievements,
**I want** each achievement to feel like a story beat,
**so that** milestones feel meaningful and connected to the world.

---

## Narrative Context: The Sanctum Remembers

> *"The Sanctum remembers everything. Every victory. Every failure. Every time someone did something that had never been done before."*
>
> *"Achievements are the Sanctum's way of acknowledging you. Don't let it go to your head—the Sanctum has acknowledged thousands."*

### Design Philosophy

Achievements should:
- Celebrate accomplishments through Warden voice
- Reveal additional lore
- Reference specific characters and events
- Feel earned, not handed out
- Connect to the broader narrative
