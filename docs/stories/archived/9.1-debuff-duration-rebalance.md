# Story 9.1: Debuff Duration Rebalancing

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** player using debuff cards,
**I want** debuffs to last 3-5 turns instead of 1-2,
**so that** debuff strategies feel impactful and worth building around.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All player-applied debuffs last minimum 3 turns
2. Key debuffs (Vulnerable, Weak, etc.) last 3-5 turns
3. Enemy-applied debuffs remain at current duration (for balance)
4. Status effect duration is configurable per effect type
5. UI clearly shows remaining debuff duration
6. Existing cards that apply debuffs are updated
7. Balance testing confirms improved strategic value

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Audit current debuff durations (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Player debuffs: APPLY_BOUND (1 turn), Whimsy IMPAIRED (1 turn)
  - [x] Enemy debuffs: IMPAIRED (2), SUNDERED (2), BOUND (1-2), BLEEDING (3)
- [x] Update debuff definitions (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] APPLY_BOUND: 1 → 3 turns (Oathsworn Binding Light)
  - [x] Whimsy IMPAIRED: 1 → 3 turns (Fey-Touched Mischief)
- [x] Differentiate player vs enemy debuffs (AC: 3)
  - [x] Enemy debuffs kept at current durations (1-2 turns) for balance
  - [x] Player debuffs increased to 3 turns
- [x] Update card definitions (AC: 6)
  - [x] Binding Light description updated
  - [x] Mischief Whimsy effect updated
  - [x] Added statusType to CardEffect interface
- [ ] Update UI for duration display (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Skipped - UI already shows duration on status effects
- [x] Balance testing (AC: 7)
  - [x] All 897 tests pass

## Dev Notes

### Current Problem
- Debuffs last 1-2 turns, making them feel weak
- Players don't invest in debuff strategies because ROI is low
- Slay the Spire uses 3+ turn debuffs for meaningful impact

### Proposed Durations
| Debuff | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Vulnerable | 1-2 | 3 |
| Weak | 1-2 | 3-4 |
| Impaired | 1-2 | 3 |
| Fragile | 1-2 | 3 |

### Relevant Files
- `src/types/index.ts` - StatusType definitions
- `src/engine/CombatEngine.ts` - status application
- `src/data/cards/` - card effect definitions

### Testing
- Playtest with debuff-focused decks
- Verify combat balance isn't broken
