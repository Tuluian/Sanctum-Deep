# Story 9.1: Debuff Duration Rebalancing

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player using debuff cards,
**I want** debuffs to last 3-5 turns instead of 1-2,
**so that** debuff strategies feel impactful and worth building around.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All player-applied debuffs last minimum 3 turns
2. Key debuffs (Vulnerable, Weak, etc.) last 3-5 turns
3. Enemy-applied debuffs remain at current duration (for balance)
4. Status effect duration is configurable per effect type
5. UI clearly shows remaining debuff duration
6. Existing cards that apply debuffs are updated
7. Balance testing confirms improved strategic value

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit current debuff durations (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] List all debuff effects and current durations
  - [ ] Identify which need adjustment
- [ ] Update debuff definitions (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [ ] Vulnerable: 1-2 turns → 3 turns
  - [ ] Weak: 1-2 turns → 3 turns
  - [ ] Other debuffs: review and adjust
- [ ] Differentiate player vs enemy debuffs (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Keep enemy debuffs shorter for balance
  - [ ] Or: separate duration configs
- [ ] Update card definitions (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Cards that apply debuffs use new durations
- [ ] Update UI for duration display (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Show turn counter on debuff icons
- [ ] Balance testing (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Test debuff-heavy builds
  - [ ] Verify not overpowered

## Dev Notes

### Current Problem
- Debuffs last 1-2 turns, making them feel weak
- Players don't invest in debuff strategies because ROI is low
- Slay the Spire uses 3+ turn debuffs for meaningful impact

### Proposed Durations
| Debuff | Current | Proposed |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Vulnerable | 1-2 | 3 |
| Weak | 1-2 | 3-4 |
| Impaired | 1-2 | 3 |
| Fragile | 1-2 | 3 |

### Relevant Files
- `src/types/index.ts` - StatusType definitions
- `src/engine/CombatEngine.ts` - status application
- `src/data/cards/` - card effect definitions

### Testing
- Playtest with debuff-focused decks
- Verify combat balance isn't broken
