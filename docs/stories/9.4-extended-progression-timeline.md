# Story 9.4: Extended Progression Timeline (200 Hours)

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** dedicated player,
**I want** the full upgrade/unlock path to take ~200 hours of gameplay,
**so that** I have long-term goals and the game rewards sustained engagement.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Full unlock progression requires ~200 hours (up from original 50 hours)
2. Progression curve is satisfying (frequent small rewards, rare big rewards)
3. Core gameplay unlocks within first 5-10 hours
4. Class mastery takes 20-30 hours per class
5. Completionist content (all upgrades, all classes) = 200 hours
6. Progression tracking visible to player
7. No pay-to-skip progression (maintains fair monetization)

## Progression Breakdown

### Hours 0-10: Core Experience
- Tutorial and basic mechanics
- Both free classes playable (Cleric, Dungeon Knight)
- First few card unlocks
- First relics discovered

### Hours 10-50: Class Exploration

- Discover most relics
- Complete Act 3 with multiple classes
- Unlock basic meta-progression rewards

### Hours 50-100: Mastery Phase

- Class-specific achievements
- True Ending requirements
- Tier 3 upgrades accessible

### Hours 100-200: Completionist Content

## Dev Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Respect player time**: Every hour should feel productive
- **Avoid artificial grind**: Progression tied to skill, not repetition
- **Multiple paths**: Different players unlock in different orders
- **No FOMO**: Everything unlockable at player's pace

### Progression Multipliers
Consider awarding bonus progression for:
- First-time boss kills (+50% XP)
- Class completion bonuses
- Achievement milestones
- Daily/weekly first wins

### Anti-Frustration Features
- Bad luck protection on card draws
- Guaranteed progression even on failed runs
- Catch-up mechanics for underplayed classes
