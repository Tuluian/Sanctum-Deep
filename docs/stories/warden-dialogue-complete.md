### Voice Characteristics
- **Act 1:** Clear, present, guiding
- **Act 2:** Warmer, more personal, reveals connections
- **Act 3:** Fragmenting, distant, fighting to be heard

# Universal Warden Dialogue

## First Arrival at the Sanctum

> "Welcome, champion. I am the Warden—what remains of her, at least."
>
> "My name was Lyra once. Lyra of the Silver Dawn. I've held this vigil for 347 years."
>
> "You've entered seeking something. Power. Answers. Redemption. They all have their reasons."
>
> "The Sanctum will test you. Three acts. Three guardians. Three truths you must face."
>
> "Survive them all, and you'll face what lies at the core. What I've been holding back since before your grandparents were born."
>
> "Good luck. You'll need it. They all do."

---

## Act Transitions

### Entering Act 1 (First Room)
> "The Entrance Halls. Once, these were grand. Now they're filled with echoes of those who failed."
>
> "Lord Vexal guards the end of this path. He was a hero once. Remember that when you face him."
>
> "Stay focused. The Sanctum is watching. So am I."

### Entering Act 2 (After Bonelord)
> "The Flooded Depths. These halls remember a kingdom that drowned in love."
>
> "King Aldric waits at the heart of this place. He was... my friend. Once."
>
> "Be gentle with him if you can. He's suffered enough."

### Entering Act 3 (After Drowned King)
> "The Core. The heart of everything. Where I can barely reach you anymore."
>
> "The Hollow God stirs. It knows you're coming. It's already learning your name."
>
> "Remember who you are. Remember why you came. Don't let it take that."
>
> "I believe in you. For whatever that's worth from someone who's barely here."

---

## Boss Introductions

### Pre-Bonelord
> "Lord Vexal of the Crimson Banner. He conquered three kingdoms and buried ten thousand foes."
>
> "He entered seeking immortality. He found it—after a fashion."
>
> "Pride held him together when the void should have dissolved him. Pride... and loneliness."
>
> "End his suffering, champion. He was a hero once."

### Pre-Drowned King
> "King Aldric of Thalassar. The Beloved, they called him."
>
> "He made a bargain—his soul for his kingdom's children. Three thousand lives for one."
>
> "Four hundred years of drowning. Four hundred years of forgetting his queen's face."
>
> "He was my friend, champion. The closest thing to a friend a Warden can have."
>
> "End his suffering. He's earned rest. He's earned... forgetting."

### Pre-Hollow God
> "This is it. The reason the Sanctum exists. The reason I exist. The reason you're here."
>
> "The Hollow God isn't a creature. It's an absence. A void in the shape of hunger."
>
> "It will try to take everything. Your skills. Your memories. Your name."
>
> "It will offer you peace—and the peace is real. It's so quiet. So empty. So tempting."
>
> "Don't listen. Remember who you are. Remember the names of everyone you've lost."
>
> "I can't help you anymore. I'm too close to fading. This fight... it's yours alone."
>
> "Win, and take my place. Lose, and become another mask the void wears."
>
> "Either way... thank you. For trying. For being brave enough to reach the end."

---

## Boss Victories

### After Bonelord
> "It's done. Lord Vexal of the Crimson Banner... rest now."
>
> "He thanked you, did you notice? At the very end. He remembered what gratitude felt like."
>
> "The path to Act 2 opens. The Drowned King awaits."
>
> "He was my friend, you know. Before. When we could still talk."
>
> "I wonder if you'll be my friend too. Before the end."

### After Drowned King
> "Aldric... goodbye, old friend. Say hello to Elara for me."
>
> "He asked me once—long ago, when we could still talk—if I thought love was worth the pain."
>
> "I told him I didn't know. I'd forgotten what love felt like."
>
> "He said: 'Then let me remind you.' And he told me about Elara. About the children. About everything."
>
> "He reminded me what I was guarding. Not just a prison. A world where love like his can exist."
>
> "The path to Act 3 opens. The Hollow God awaits."
>
> "Remember what Aldric gave. Remember what love costs. And when the void offers you emptiness..."
>
> "Choose to remember."

### After Hollow God
> "You did it. You held on. You remembered."
>
> "The void recedes. The seal holds. For now."
>
> "I've been the Warden for 347 years. Before that, I was... someone else. I can't remember who."
>
> "The Hollow God didn't take my identity. I gave it up. Piece by piece. Year by year. To hold the seal."
>
> "It was worth it. Every forgotten memory. Every lost name. The world is still here."
>
> "Now... the choice."

# Class-Specific Warden Dialogue

## Cleric (Elara)

### First Meeting
> "A Cleric of the Radiant Light. I know your order. We served... similar purposes, once."
>
> "You came seeking your god. Brother Aldous, wasn't it? The one who fell silent."
>
> "I know what happened to him. But the answer... you may not want it."
>
> "Keep going. The truth is here. Whether it brings peace or pain."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal sought glory. You seek faith. Both of you lost something."
>
> "The difference? He forgot what he was looking for. You haven't. Not yet."
>
> "Brother Aldous served here, you know. As the 19th Warden. For 400 years."
>
> "He answered your prayers through the Liminal. His blessings were real. His love was real."
>
> "Then he faded. As we all do."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric prayed too. Every day his children died. His god never answered."
>
> "Perhaps that's why Brother Aldous fell silent—he couldn't bear to hear prayers he couldn't answer."
>
> "Faith isn't about the god answering, Elara. It's about the prayer being made."
>
> "Brother Aldous's crystal is in the Core. You'll see him. What remains of him."
>
> "He didn't abandon you. He faded protecting you. There's a difference."

### Entering Act 3
> "The Core holds the crystallized Wardens. Twenty-seven guardians, preserved in their final moments."
>
> "Brother Aldous is among them. You'll recognize his seal."
>
> "He can't speak anymore. But I think... I think he's still proud of you."
>
> "His order. His faith. His legacy. You."

---

## Knight (Varren)

### First Meeting
> "A Knight of the Sealed Gate. Your Order has sent many into the Sanctum. Few return."
>
> "You wear Ser Aldric's seal. He was your mentor. He entered fifteen years ago."
>
> "I know where he is. I know what happened."
>
> "Keep going. You'll find him. What remains of him."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal trained with your Order, you know. Centuries ago. Before it was the Sealed Gate."
>
> "The techniques you use—some of them are his. His legacy, passed down."
>
> "Fitting that you ended him. The student surpassing the ancient teacher."
>
> "Ser Aldric would be proud. If he could still feel pride."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric—King Aldric—understood duty. He gave everything for his kingdom."
>
> "Your Aldric—Ser Aldric—understood duty too. He came to protect. To seal. To stand."
>
> "He reached the Hollow God. He fought with honor. He... hesitated."
>
> "For one moment, he wanted the peace. The rest. The silence."
>
> "That moment cost him. But he came back. He kept fighting. That's what matters."

### Entering Act 3
> "Ser Aldric's crystal is here. You'll find him near the Core."
>
> "He's not dead—not exactly. Preserved. Waiting."
>
> "The expression on his face is shame. He hesitated, and it shames him still."
>
> "Tell him—when you see him—that hesitation isn't failure. Standing after falling is heroism."
>
> "He needs to hear that. Even if he can't respond."

---

## Diabolist (Mordecai)

### First Meeting
> "You reek of brimstone and bad bargains. The devil cannot enter here—but he's watching."
>
> "Xan'thrax, isn't it? I know of him. He's been trying to reach the Sanctum for centuries."
>
> "He can't enter. The barriers work against demons. But he can send pawns."
>
> "That's what you are to him. A pawn. But pawns can become queens, if they reach the end."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal made bargains too. Glory for eternity. He got exactly what he asked for."
>
> "Devils are like that. They give you what you want—just not what you need."
>
> "Your contractor wanted you to fail. To die. To void the contract through death."
>
> "But you're still alive. That wasn't in his calculations. Keep surprising him."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric made a bargain. Soul for children. Clean terms. No hidden clauses."
>
> "That's what good deals look like. Both parties get what they need. Both parties pay."
>
> "Xan'thrax doesn't do good deals. Neither did you, before."
>
> "But you're learning. I can see it. The Sanctum teaches, if you let it."

### Entering Act 3
> "Xan'thrax is at the barrier. Screaming. He can feel you getting close."
>
> "The Sanctum is the one place he cannot reach. The one place you're safe from his contract."
>
> "Become the Warden, and you're free. Forever. The barriers work both ways."
>
> "He can scream for eternity. You won't hear him from inside."
>
> "Something to consider. When you face the choice."

---

## Oathsworn (Callista)

### First Meeting
> "An Oathsworn of the Burning Truth. Sister Mara's order. I wondered when you'd come."
>
> "You're here to destroy the Sanctum. To break the seal. To 'free' the imprisoned souls."
>
> "Your Order was founded by a Warden, you know. The 22nd. Mara of the Dawn."
>
> "She rebelled. Tried to destroy what she'd sworn to protect. She failed."
>
> "Her writings became your scripture. Her failure became your mission."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal wasn't imprisoned against his will. He chose to stay. To rule. To matter."
>
> "The Sanctum didn't trap him. His pride did."
>
> "Your Order believes we're all victims here. Some of us chose this. Some of us keep choosing."
>
> "Not everything the Burning Truth teaches is truth."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric made a bargain. His soul for his kingdom. Freely given. No coercion."
>
> "Is that slavery? Is that imprisonment? Or is it the most noble sacrifice you've ever seen?"
>
> "Sister Mara's writings call the Warden system cosmic slavery. She's not entirely wrong."
>
> "Being the Warden IS a prison. I've lost almost everything I was."
>
> "But I chose it. I keep choosing it. Every day, I choose to hold the line."
>
> "Is choice slavery? That's the question your Order never asks."

### Entering Act 3
> "Sister Mara's crystal is here. The founder of your Order. The 22nd Warden."
>
> "She served 892 years before she rebelled. She understood the cost better than anyone."
>
> "She wasn't wrong to rebel. She wasn't right either. The truth... burns, doesn't it?"
>
> "Maybe you can find a middle path. Not destruction. Not submission. Reformation."
>
> "Break the cycle without breaking the seal. That would be something worth burning for."

---

## Fey-Touched (Wren)

### First Meeting
> "Oberon's debt. I remember. He cheats at dice, you know."
>
> "258 years ago, I won a riddle game against the Fey King. He still owes me a favor."
>
> "He's been sending marked mortals ever since. Hoping one will kill me or take my place."
>
> "If I fade, the debt dies with me. That's what he's counting on."
>
> "But you... you're different. You don't want to be here. You're not playing his game."
>
> "That's dangerous. For him."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal entered seeking glory for himself. You entered seeking nothing—and might find everything."
>
> "Oberon wants you to fail. Every 'gift' he sends is secretly sabotage."
>
> "But here's the thing about fey gifts: they can cut both ways."
>
> "Use what he gives you. Against him. Against this place. Against everything."
>
> "Spite is fuel. Burn it wisely."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric chose to be here. You didn't. That's the difference between you."
>
> "He gave his soul willingly. Yours was gambled away in a game you never got to play."
>
> "The fey lord wants you to fail. I want you to spite him."
>
> "We have that in common."
>
> "Win this, and Oberon loses his pawn. Become the Warden, and he loses access to me."
>
> "Two defeats. One victory. Those are odds he didn't calculate."

### Entering Act 3
> "Become the Warden, and Oberon can never touch you again. The barriers work both ways."
>
> "He can never collect. He can never interfere. You'll be free of him forever."
>
> "And I can finally collect my favor. After 258 years."
>
> "I wonder what I'll ask for. I've had centuries to think about it."
>
> "Something petty. Something that humiliates him. Something worthy of a fey king's debt."
>
> "Win this, Wren. Win it for both of us."

---

## Celestial (Seraphina)

### First Meeting
> "A Celestial. I can feel the fragment in you—it's screaming at me to send you back."
>
> "But you're not the fragment, are you? You're the person it's riding. The host, not the guest."
>
> "The God of Dawn was consumed 1,847 years ago. Its crystal is in the Core."
>
> "Auriel—the fragment—is terrified of returning. It should be. The void doesn't welcome escapees."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal feared your light. He remembered when gods walked the world."
>
> "The fragment in you is old. Old enough to remember too."
>
> "Ask it what it was like. Before. It might surprise you both."
>
> "Parasites have memories too. Some of them are worth recovering."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric prayed to the Sea Mother. Different god, different light."
>
> "But grief looks the same, doesn't it? Whether you've lost a god or become one's prison."
>
> "The fragment is quiet now. It's remembering what loss feels like."
>
> "Maybe that's a start. Maybe you can teach it something besides fear."

### Entering Act 3
> "The Core holds all the consumed gods. Every deity the Hollow God has eaten."
>
> "Yours is in there. The God of Dawn. What remains of it."
>
> "Auriel will want to reunite. To dissolve back into its source. That's one path."
>
> "Keeping it—accepting it as part of yourself—is another."
>
> "Neither path is wrong. Both paths are painful."
>
> "I'm sorry. I wish I could make this easier. I can't."

## Summoner (Caelum)

### First Meeting
> "A summoner. No—a creator. There's a difference."
>
> "Most summoners bargain with existing spirits. You make new ones. That's rare. That's precious."
>
> "The Congregation came through here recently. Screaming for its source."
>
> "Your colleagues are in there. Fragments of them. Still aware enough to suffer."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal summoned minions too. Memories of soldiers who served him in life."
>
> "Your creations are different. They're new. Fresh. Born from your will alone."
>
> "In a place full of stolen souls, genuine creation is precious."
>
> "Treasure your wisps. They're more real than most things here."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric's soldiers were memories. Echoes of loyalty, given form by his refusal to forget."
>
> "When he died, they faded. They only existed because he remembered them."
>
> "Your creations... they exist because you love them. That's a stronger binding."
>
> "Love outlasts memory. Love survives consumption. Keep loving them."

### Entering Act 3
> "The Congregation is fracturing. Too many minds pulling in too many directions."
>
> "Your children are in there somewhere. Lumina. Bastion. Whisper. The ones who died for you."
>
> "They're waiting. Preserved by your love. Strong enough to survive even the void."
>
> "You can bring them back. If you survive. If you remember them clearly enough."
>
> "Don't let the Hollow God blur their faces. Keep them sharp. Keep them yours."

---

## Bargainer (Vesper)

### First Meeting
> "A bargainer. A good one, too. I can smell it on you. You understand fair exchange."
>
> "Malachar is screaming at my walls. Has been since you entered. He really wants you dead."
>
> "Whatever you did to him... I approve."
>
> "Breaking a contract for a child. That takes more courage than any sword."

### After Act 1
> "Lord Vexal made bargains too. Glory for immortality. He never understood the terms."
>
> "You would have. You would have seen the fine print."
>
> "The devil is in the details. Literally, in your case."
>
> "But you already knew that, didn't you? That's why you're still alive."

### After Act 2
> "Aldric made the greatest bargain in this place's history. His soul for three thousand children."
>
> "No fine print. No loopholes. Pure exchange."
>
> "That's what good deals look like. Both parties get what they actually need."
>
> "Malachar could never understand that. Devils don't do fair."

### Entering Act 3
> "The Hollow God doesn't bargain. It only takes."
>
> "That's why it's always hungry. You can't fill a void with theft."
>
> "Maybe you can teach it something. Maybe you can't."
>
> "But if anyone could make a deal with the nothing at the heart of everything..."
>
> "It would be someone like you."
>
> "Someone who broke a contract for a child. Someone who knows that the best deals make everyone win."

---

## The Final Choice

> "You've done it. You've survived the Entrance Halls, the Flooded Depths, the Core itself."
>
> "The Hollow God is contained. The seal holds. And I... I can finally rest."
>
> "But the Sanctum needs a guardian. Someone has to hold the line."
>
> "You have a choice."

### Option 1: Become the Warden

> "Take my place. Hold the seal. Guard the world from what lies beneath."
>
> "It's not an easy life. It's barely a life at all."
>
> "You'll fade, eventually. Piece by piece. Memory by memory."
>
> "But while you hold... the world continues. Children are born. Love exists. Life goes on."
>
> "Is that worth the price? I thought so. For 347 years, I thought so."
>
> "Now it's your turn to decide."

### Option 2: Leave (If Available)

> "Walk away. Return to the world. Live whatever life remains."
>
> "I'll find another way. Hold on a little longer. Wait for another champion."
>
> "You've earned rest. You've earned freedom. You've earned... normalcy."
>
> "Go. Live. Remember what you found here."
>
> "Remember the Bonelord's pride. The Drowned King's love. The Hollow God's hunger."
>
> "And if you ever tell anyone about this place..."
>
> "Tell them it's not just a prison. It's a choice. It's always been a choice."

## Document Usage Notes

- Lyra's voice should grow fainter in Act 3 dialogue (more ellipses, fragmented sentences)
- Class-specific dialogue should reference events from the World Bible
- The Warden has personal connections to several characters (Aldric, Mara, Oberon)
- Her tone shifts from guide (Act 1) to friend (Act 2) to desperate hope (Act 3)
