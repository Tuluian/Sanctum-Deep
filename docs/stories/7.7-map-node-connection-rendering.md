# Story 7.7: Map Node Connection Rendering Fix

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player navigating the dungeon map,
**I want** connection lines between nodes to render correctly at all zoom levels,
**so that** I can clearly see available paths through the dungeon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Connection lines follow the same zoom ratio as nodes
2. Connection lines remain visible in the last 25% of the map
3. Lines connect visually to node centers at all zoom levels
4. Panning and zooming preserves line-to-node relationships
5. Connection lines render with consistent thickness at all scales
6. Performance remains smooth during zoom/pan operations

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Investigate connection rendering bug (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Reproduce at different zoom levels
  - [ ] Identify transform mismatch between nodes and lines
- [ ] Fix connection line zoom scaling (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Apply same transform to lines as nodes
  - [ ] Recalculate line endpoints on zoom
- [ ] Fix last 25% cutoff issue (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Check viewport clipping logic
  - [ ] Extend render area or remove early cutoff
- [ ] Test line-node alignment (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Verify at min/max zoom
  - [ ] Test with pan + zoom combinations
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

### Bug Description
- Map connection nodes are cut off after the last 25%
- When zooming, connection lines don't follow the same ratio as nodes do
- Nodes move but lines stay in original positions

### Relevant Files
- `src/ui/screens/MapScreen.ts` - map rendering
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - drawing utilities
- CSS for map zoom transforms

### Testing
- Manual testing at various zoom levels
- Check Act 1, 2, 3 maps for consistency
