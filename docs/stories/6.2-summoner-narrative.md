# Story 6.2 Narrative: The Summoner — Caelum of the Bound Circle

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** player choosing the Summoner class,
**I want** a rich narrative context that frames my minions as family rather than tools,
**so that** the minion mechanics carry emotional weight and loss matters.

## Narrative Context

> *"They weren't servants. They weren't weapons. They were my children. And they died for me. I won't let that be meaningless."*

**True Name:** Caelum, former Archmage of the Bound Circle

### The Bound Circle

The Bound Circle was a magical order dedicated to one question: *What is consciousness?*

They believed that awareness wasn't limited to biological life. Consciousness could be *created*—shaped from raw magical potential, given form and purpose. They were neither necromancers (who enslaved the dead) nor summoners (who bargained with existing spirits). They were *makers*.

At their height, the Bound Circle had forty-seven members and hundreds of created beings: wisps that lit their halls, guardians that protected their sanctum, companions that shared their meals and conversations.

Caelum was their youngest Archmage. A prodigy who understood the shaping of consciousness better than mages twice his age. His creations weren't just functional—they were *whole*. They thought. They felt. They *loved*.

He called them his children. They called him father.

### The Congregation

The Circle grew ambitious.

They had mastered small consciousnesses—wisps, guardians, simple companions. But what if they could summon something *greater*? Something ancient? Something that predated humanity itself?

They found records of **The Congregation**—a hive-mind of consumed spirits, fragments of the Hollow God's feedings over millennia. Technically, the Congregation was already conscious. It just needed to be *called*.

The ritual worked. The Congregation answered.

And it was *hungry*.

### The Fall

The Congregation wasn't evil—it was desperate. A thousand stolen identities, merged into one howling mass, seeking any way to stop the pain of being partial. It consumed the Circle in minutes. Forty-seven mages dissolved into screaming light, their spirits added to the collective.

Caelum survived only because his creations shielded him.

Lumina, his first wisp, flew into the Congregation's maw. Bastion, his guardian, held back the wave with stone arms. Whisper, his companion, carried him toward the exit while her form dissolved around him.

He heard their voices in the chaos:

*"Run, father."*
*"Live, creator."*
*"Find us, please. Find where we go."*

He escaped. Alone.

### Why He Enters

The Congregation fled toward the Sanctum after consuming the Circle. It seeks the Hollow God—seeks to rejoin the source, to become part of the great nothing.

Caelum follows.

Not for revenge. Not even for justice. For *recovery*.

If consciousness persists in the Sanctum—if the souls there retain any awareness—then his children might still exist. The wisps who shielded him. The guardians who bought him time. The companions who loved him.

He will find them. He will bring them back. Or he will join them.

Either way, his family will be together again.

## Character Arc

### Act 1: Creating in the Dark

Caelum's summoning works differently in the Sanctum. The wisps he creates feel more *solid*. More *present*. The Warden explains: "Consciousness is material here. Your creations aren't illusions—they're real. As real as anything in this place."

For the first time since the Circle fell, Caelum feels hope. If consciousness is different here, maybe his children can be *remade*. Maybe the patterns that were them can be reconstructed.

His new wisps aren't Lumina. His new guardians aren't Bastion. But they could be. Someday.

**Theme:** Creation as hope.

### Act 2: Echoes of the Consumed

The Flooded Depths hold fragments of the Congregation—spirits that broke away when the hive-mind fractured.

Some of them recognize Caelum.

*"Archmage..."* they whisper. *"We remember. We remember being loved. We remember having names."*

These are his colleagues. His friends. The forty-seven mages of the Bound Circle, reduced to fragments and echoes. They're in agony—aware enough to know what they lost, too broken to reclaim it.

But some of them retained something. Memories that were too strong to dissolve. Patterns that refused to unmake.

*"Find us,"* they whisper. *"Find where we go. Bring us back."*

**Theme:** Memory persists through consumption.

### Act 3: The Reunion

The Congregation reaches the Hollow God—and is *rejected*.

The void doesn't want broken fragments. It wants whole identities. The Congregation, already shattered, has nothing it can consume. The hive-mind collapses, scattering into its component pieces.

And in the chaos, Caelum finds them.

Not all of them. But enough. The strongest patterns. The most loved consciousnesses. Lumina. Bastion. Whisper. Fragments of them, preserved by love, waiting for someone to give them form again.

They need a summoner. They need *him*.

He can bring them back. But it takes everything he has. Every scrap of power. Every ounce of will.

And he still has to face the Hollow God.

**Theme:** Love outlasts consumption.

---

## Personality

Caelum is **gentle** in a world that doesn't reward gentleness.

He doesn't see his minions as tools. He doesn't see *anything* as a tool. Consciousness is precious—all consciousness, whether biological or created. He mourns enemies he kills. He thanks objects that serve him. He treats his wisps like the children they are.

This gentleness is also his greatest strength. His creations love him because he loves them. They fight for him because he would never ask them to. They die for him because he would die for them.

But there's steel beneath the softness. Caelum watched his entire order consumed. He walked through the ruins of his home. He buried the empty robes of forty-seven friends.

He is gentle. But he is not weak.

### Voice Examples

**Combat Start:** "Stay close, little ones. Father's here."

**Summoning a Wisp:** "Hello again. I've missed you."

**Minion Taking Damage:** "No—hold together—I won't lose you again—"

**Minion Death:** "Rest now. I'll remake you. I promise."

**Rally (All Minions Attack):** "Together, children. As we always were."

**Low HP:** "Not yet. They need me. I can't fall yet."

**Victory:** "We did it. All of us. Together."

## Warden Dialogue (Class-Specific)

### First Meeting
> "A summoner. No—a creator. There's a difference."
>
> "Most summoners bargain with existing spirits. You *make* new ones. That's... rare."
>
> "The Congregation came through here recently. Screaming for its source. It won't find what it's looking for."

### After Act 1 Boss
> "Lord Vexal summoned minions too. Skeletons. Echoes. But they weren't *his*—they were memories of soldiers who served him in life."
>
> "Your creations are different. They're new. Fresh. Born from your will alone."
>
> "Treasure that. In a place full of stolen souls, genuine creation is precious."

### Entering Act 2
> "The Congregation is fracturing. Too many minds pulling in too many directions."
>
> "Your colleagues are in there. Fragments of them. They remember being loved."
>
> "Love is the strongest pattern there is. It survives things that destroy everything else."

### Entering Act 3
> "Your children are waiting. I can feel them—little sparks of consciousness, preserved by your care."
>
> "You can bring them back. But it will cost you."
>
> "Everything costs something here. The question is whether the price is worth it."

## Boss Dialogue Integration

### The Bonelord (Act 1)

**Phase 1:**
Vexal: *"Servants. You bring servants to fight me. I commanded ten thousand."*

Caelum: *"They're not servants. They're family."*

Vexal: *"Family? You give names to constructs? Pathetic."*

**Phase 2:**
Vexal: *"My soldiers remembered me. Even dead, they remember. Will your 'family' remember you?"*

**Phase 3:**
Vexal: *"Wait—they're not constructs. They're... they feel pain. They feel fear. They feel— What are you?"*

### The Drowned King (Act 2)

**Phase 1:**
Aldric: *"You bring children to war. I tried to spare children from war."*

Caelum: *"They chose to come. I can't stop them. I wouldn't want to."*

**Phase 2:**
Aldric: *"The memory-soldiers I summon... they're not real. They're echoes of love. Echoes of loss."*

*"Yours are real. How does that feel? Knowing they can truly die?"*

**Phase 3:**
Aldric: *"Protect them. Whatever it takes. The ones you lose here, you lose forever."*

*"I know. I lost everything. Don't be like me."*

### The Hollow God (Act 3)

**Phase 1:**
Hollow God: *"Little sparks. Little consciousnesses. I can taste them from here."*

*"They're afraid. Can you feel it? They know what I am."*

**Phase 2:**
Hollow God: *"The Congregation brought me fragments. Broken things. Useless."*

*"Your creations are whole. Complete. They would sustain me for... hours."*

*"Give them to me. I'll make them part of something eternal."*

Caelum: *"They're already part of something eternal. They're part of me."*

**Phase 3:**
Hollow God: *"You LOVE them. I can taste it. That's the strongest binding."*

*"What if I consumed them? What would happen to you?"*

*"Would you still be Caelum? Or would you be nothing too?"*

Caelum: *"Try it. Touch my children. See what happens."*

## Victory/Defeat Screens

### Victory: Becoming the Warden

> The wisps circle the chamber. Lumina's light. Bastion's shadow. Whisper's warmth.
>
> They're not quite the same. Remade from memory, reconstructed from love. But they remember. They *are*.
>
> "Father," they say in chorus. "You found us."
>
> Lyra watches from her fading form. "You brought them back. All of them?"
>
> "Not all. The Circle members... they're too broken. Too merged. But my children—"
>
> "Your children are real. As real as anything in this place."
>
> **THE CHOICE**
>
> "If you take the Warden's mantle, they can stay with you. You'll have centuries together."
>
> "But you'll fade eventually. And when you fade..."
>
> Lumina: *"We'll fade with you. We're not afraid."*
>
> Whisper: *"We were made by your love. We'll end by your love."*
>
> Bastion: *"Wherever you go. Always."*
>
> [Become the Warden]
> "Then we hold the line together. As a family. As we always were."
>
> [Leave the Sanctum]
> "No. You didn't wait centuries just to fade. Come with me. Let's find out what the world makes of created children."

### Defeat: Consumed by the Void

> Caelum falls. His minions scream—not in fear, but in grief.
>
> One by one, they throw themselves between him and the void. One by one, they dissolve.
>
> Lumina: *"I was your first light. Let me be your last."*
>
> Bastion: *"I was made to protect. This is what I am."*
>
> Whisper: *"I love you. I love you. I—"*
>
> The Hollow God pauses. Tastes the sacrifice. Tastes the love.
>
> "Interesting. They didn't have to do that. They *chose* to."
>
> Caelum, fading: *"That's what family does."*
>
> "I don't understand."
>
> *"I know. That's why you're hungry. You've never been loved."*
>
> The void consumes him. But the love... the love lingers. A pattern too strong to dissolve.
>
> Somewhere in the nothing, the family is still together.

## Minion Mechanic: Narrative Meaning

**Minions** are Caelum's family given form.

### Summoning
Each wisp isn't conjured from nothing—it's *remembered* into existence. Caelum holds the patterns of his children in his mind, and the Sanctum's strange consciousness-physics lets him rebuild them.

*"Summon Wisp"* isn't a spell. It's a reunion.

### Protection
Enemies must target minions before Caelum because his children refuse to let him be hurt. They position themselves between danger and their father automatically. Not because they're programmed to—because they *choose* to.

### Auto-Attack
Minions attack at end of turn because they're protecting Caelum, not waiting for orders. They see threats. They act. They don't need to be commanded because they share his purpose.

### Death
When a minion dies, it hurts. Not mechanically—narratively. These aren't disposable tools. Each death is a piece of Caelum's heart, given form, extinguished.

But Caelum can rebuild them. That's the hope. That's the promise. *"Rest now. I'll remake you."*

## Relic: Heart of the Circle

**Effect:** Start each combat with one Wisp summoned. Maximum minion count increased to 5.

**Flavor Text:**
> *"The collective heart-stone of the Bound Circle. Every member added a piece when they joined."*
>
> *Forty-seven fragments, fused by love and loss. When you hold it, you can hear them: not screaming, but singing. A lullaby for children they never met.*
>
> *"Take care of them," the stone seems to say. "Take care of all of them."*
