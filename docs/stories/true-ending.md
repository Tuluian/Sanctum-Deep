# True Ending: The Breaking of the Cycle

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** player who has completed the game with all 5 classes,
**I want** access to a secret True Ending,
**so that** I experience the ultimate resolution of the Sanctum's story.

---

## Unlock Requirements

The True Ending becomes available when:
1. Player has beaten the Hollow God with all 5 classes
2. Player has become the Warden at least once
3. On the 6th+ victory, a new option appears

---

## The Third Choice

After defeating the Hollow God, the standard choice appears:
- **Become the Warden** (familiar)
- **Leave the Sanctum** (bad ending - Hollow God eventually escapes)

But now, a third option flickers:

> **"Break the Cycle"**
> *"You've walked five paths. You've learned five truths. You know what the others never knew—there IS another way."*

---

## The True Ending Sequence

### The Warden's Surprise

When you select "Break the Cycle," the Warden's expression changes:

> "You... you want to end this? Truly end it?"
>
> *[They look at you with something between hope and terror.]*
>
> "I've waited centuries for someone to find this path. I couldn't tell you—the knowledge had to come from understanding. From walking every road."
>
> *[They stand straighter. The fading stops.]*
>
> "The Hollow God can't be killed. But it can be... filled. Satisfied. Given what it hungers for—once and for all."
>
> "It hungers for identity. For memory. For meaning."
>
> *[They gesture at the crystallized Wardens.]*
>
> "We've been starving it. Holding it back. But what if... we fed it? Everything. All at once."
>
> "What if we gave it what it wanted—and in that giving, made it... whole?"

---

### The Summoning

The Warden raises their hand. The crystals crack.

> "Come. All of you. Everyone who held the line."

The previous Wardens step from their crystals—not as ghosts, but as echoes. Faded, translucent, but *present*:

> **Theron the Builder:** "You called. I... remember being called."
>
> **Mara of the Dawn:** "A final purpose. Finally."
>
> **The Nameless One:** "I don't remember my name. But I remember *why*."
>
> **And others—dozens, hundreds, stretching back millennia.**

The Warden turns to you:

> "We will give the Hollow God every name we ever had. Every memory we ever held. Every regret, every joy, every moment of being *someone*."
>
> "And you—you, who walked five paths—you will anchor us. You remember who we all were. Your memory of us... will give the gift meaning."

---

### The Five Paths Unite

Something strange happens. Around you, four other figures appear—ghostly, familiar:

- **The Cleric you played as:** Elara, faith reforged
- **The Knight you played as:** Varren, duty fulfilled
- **The Diabolist you played as:** Mordecai, contract broken
- **The Oathsworn you played as:** Callista, truth found
- **The Fey-Touched you played as:** Wren, chaos embraced

They're all you. All the runs. All the identities.

> **Your Cleric:** "I learned that faith comes from within."
>
> **Your Knight:** "I learned that the line must be held—from both sides."
>
> **Your Diabolist:** "I learned that contracts can be renegotiated."
>
> **Your Oathsworn:** "I learned that vows can evolve."
>
> **Your Fey-Touched:** "I learned that chaos is just... freedom with style."

The Warden looks at this gathering—you, your past selves, the Wardens of old—and smiles:

> "Together. We face it together. Not as guards. Not as prisoners. As gifts."

---

### Confronting the Hollow God

The Hollow God rises. Bigger than before. Hungrier.

> "YOU RETURN? YOU ALL RETURN? TO BE CONSUMED?"
>
> *[Its voice is eager now. Desperate.]*
>
> "YES. GIVE ME YOUR NAMES. GIVE ME YOUR MEMORIES. GIVE ME EVERYTHING."

The Warden steps forward:

> "We will. But first—a question. One I've held for 347 years."
>
> "What do you remember, Hollow God? What was the first thing you ever felt?"

The void stops.

> "I... I DON'T REMEMBER. I CAN'T REMEMBER. MEMORY REQUIRES..."
>
> *[It shudders.]*
>
> "MEMORY REQUIRES BEING SOMETHING. I AM NOTHING."

The Warden nods:

> "You were something once. Before. The Sanctum didn't always exist to contain you—it existed to *create* you. Or rather... to *uncreate* what you were."
>
> *[This is the secret.]*
>
> "The first Warden wasn't a guard. They were... a mistake. They tried to become a god. They poured too much identity into themselves—and the overflow became the void."
>
> "You're not a monster, Hollow God. You're an echo. A wound. A scream that never ended."
>
> *[The Hollow God's presence wavers.]*
>
> "We can't kill you. But we can heal you. If you're willing to... stop being nothing."

---

### The Choice (Hollow God)

The Hollow God speaks—not with hunger now, but with something like wonder:

> "I... could be something? I could have a name? I could... remember?"
>
> *[It reaches out—not to consume, but to accept.]*
>
> "I'm so tired of being empty. I'm so tired of forgetting what I never knew."
>
> "Will it hurt? Becoming something?"

The Warden takes its hand:

> "Yes. It will hurt to care. To remember. To be someone who can lose things."
>
> "But it's worth it. I promise. It's worth every moment."

---

### The Gift

The Wardens begin to dissolve—not consumed, but *given*. Their memories flow into the void. Their names, their regrets, their loves, their failures.

> **Theron the Builder:** "I was an architect. I built this place. My name was Theron. Remember me."
>
> **Mara of the Dawn:** "I was loved once. His name was Kael. We were going to have children. Remember us."
>
> **The Nameless One:** "I was... I was... I am giving you my name. It's all I have. Take it. Become someone."

One by one, the Wardens give everything. The Hollow God absorbs—but differently now. Not consuming. Receiving.

Your past selves step forward:

> **Your Cleric:** "I give you faith—the kind that questions and grows."
>
> **Your Knight:** "I give you duty—the kind that protects, not traps."
>
> **Your Diabolist:** "I give you bargaining—the kind that benefits both sides."
>
> **Your Oathsworn:** "I give you vows—the kind that can bend without breaking."
>
> **Your Fey-Touched:** "I give you chaos—the kind that creates, not destroys."

Finally, the Warden—Lyra—turns to you:

> "And you. You remember all of this. You are the thread that connects every gift."
>
> "Give the Hollow God what it truly needs: someone to witness its becoming."
>
> "Watch. Remember. Tell the story. That's the final gift."

---

### The Transformation

The Hollow God changes. The void fills—not with emptiness, but with memory. With identity. With *meaning*.

> "I... I feel..."
>
> *[It takes shape. Not monstrous. Not human. Something new.]*
>
> "I feel like someone. I feel like... everyone. I feel like..."
>
> *[It speaks a name—many names, all at once, somehow harmonizing:]*
>
> "I feel like home."

The Sanctum shudders. The walls dissolve. The barriers that held the void now release something else: peace.

> "I don't need to consume anymore. I... I remember enough. I am enough."
>
> *[It turns to you.]*
>
> "Thank you. Thank you for giving me what I never knew I wanted."
>
> "A self. A story. A reason to exist without hunger."

---

### Epilogue: The World After

The Sanctum is gone. Where it stood, there's now a garden—impossible, beautiful, growing in every direction at once.

At the center, a figure that isn't quite human tends the plants. It speaks with a hundred voices, all gentle:

> "I'm the gardener now. I tend what grows. I remember what was."
>
> "Heroes come here sometimes. Seekers. Pilgrims. They expect a dungeon. They find... this."
>
> "I tell them stories. About Lord Vexal's pride. About King Aldric's love. About Lyra's vigil. About you."
>
> "They leave changed. Better. More themselves."
>
> *[It smiles—a hundred smiles, layered.]*
>
> "That's what I am now. Not a god. Not a void. A garden where heroes go to grow."

---

### The Player's Legacy

**Final Screen:**

> **"THE CYCLE IS BROKEN"**
>
> Your name has been added to the Garden's heart.
>
> You will be remembered—not as a Warden, not as a champion, but as the one who taught a god to be something instead of nothing.
>
> **Five paths. One truth. Endless becoming.**

---

## Class-Specific Final Lines

Each past-self gets a personal farewell:

### Cleric (Elara)
> "My god was a Warden. Now I help create something new. Perhaps that's what faith always was—believing in what we can become."

### Knight (Varren)
> "Ser Aldric would be proud. I found him—not as Oathbroken, but as... at peace. The line held. It can finally rest."

### Diabolist (Mordecai)
> "Xan'thrax is screaming somewhere. The contract voided. The curse lifted. And I'm still here. Someone else's debt, finally paid."

### Oathsworn (Callista)
> "The Order was wrong about destruction. But they were right about one thing: the cycle had to end. Just... not through breaking. Through healing."

### Fey-Touched (Wren)
> "Oberon is silent. First time in months. I think I just became something he can't control. The look on his face... worth every bad roll."

## Developer Notes

### Tone
The True Ending should feel:
- **Cathartic** — after so much tragedy, something heals
- **Earned** — only possible after understanding all perspectives
- **Bittersweet** — the Wardens are gone, but they chose it
- **Hopeful** — the world is genuinely better

### Not a "Win"
This isn't presented as the "good" ending that makes other endings "bad." Becoming the Warden is noble. The True Ending is just... different. A possibility, not a requirement.

### The Hollow God's Redemption
The key twist: the Hollow God isn't evil. It's wounded. A cosmic wound that never healed. The True Ending doesn't defeat it—it heals it. This reframes the entire game's narrative.
