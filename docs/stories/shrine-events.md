# Shrine Events: Narrative Design

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** player exploring the Sanctum,
**I want** meaningful shrine events with narrative weight,
**so that** choices feel significant and connected to the world.

---

## Narrative Context: The Sanctum Speaks

> *"These shrines weren't always here. Previous Wardens built them—anchors of sanity in a place that consumes identity. Each one holds a memory, a gift, a warning."*

### Design Philosophy

Shrines should:
- Reveal world lore organically
- Connect to class narratives
- Offer meaningful choices (not just stat trades)
- Remind players the Sanctum was built by *people*
- Sometimes have no right answer—just different costs

## Act 1 Shrines: Memory and Loss

### Ancient Altar
*A stone altar, worn smooth by centuries of offerings. Candles burn despite no one to light them.*

**Base Choice:**
> "The altar asks for sacrifice. What will you give?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Sacrifice HP** | Lose 10% max HP, gain rare card | *"Your vitality feeds the stone. The stone gives back—something precious."* |
| **Sacrifice Gold** | Lose 50 gold, gain 15 HP | *"Gold is nothing here. But the gesture means something."* |
| **Refuse** | Nothing | *"You keep what you have. The altar... waits."* |

**Warden's Whisper:**
> "I built this altar. I don't remember why. I must have needed something. We all need something."

**Class-Specific:**
- **Cleric:** Additional option: "Pray" — Gain 2 Devotion, hear a fragment of your god's last words
- **Diabolist:** Warning appears: "Xan'thrax is watching. He wants you to sacrifice."

---

### Forgotten Grimoire
*A book rests on a pedestal, pages turning by themselves. The ink still moves.*

**Base Choice:**
> "The grimoire offers knowledge—at a price. What will you learn?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Read Deeply** | Transform a card (random upgrade), add Pain to deck | *"The knowledge burns. The mage who wrote this... she's still in the ink."* |
| **Skim Carefully** | Upgrade one card (your choice) | *"Careful knowledge. Safe knowledge. Limited knowledge."* |
| **Close It** | Nothing | *"Some things are better unread. Some doors better unopened."* |

**Lore Fragment (on Read Deeply):**
> "The grimoire was written by a mage named Thessa. She entered seeking understanding of the Hollow God. She understood too much. Now she IS the grimoire—consciousness dissolved into text."

**Class-Specific:**
- **Diabolist:** The grimoire speaks: "I know your contractor. Xan'thrax wrote three pages of this book. Would you like to read them?" (Special soul-debt related upgrade)
- **Fey-Touched:** "These pages keep rearranging. Oberon, is that you?" (Random outcome—could be upgrade, could be transformation)

---

### Cursed Idol
*A small statue, carved from something that isn't quite stone. It looks like it's trying to remember a face.*

**Base Choice:**
> "The idol offers power. The idol offers corruption. The idol offers... truth?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Accept the Gift** | Gain a powerful relic, add 2 Curses to deck | *"Power flows. So does poison. The idol remembers its maker—and its maker's mistakes."* |
| **Ask a Question** | Learn lore about upcoming boss | *"The idol shows you visions. The Drowned King's crown. His queen's tears. His choice."* |
| **Destroy It** | Gain 15 max HP, remove one card | *"The idol shatters. Something sighs with relief. Something else screams."* |

**Lore Fragment (on Ask):**
> "This idol was carved by the Hollow God's first victim—a sculptor who tried to remember their own face as the void consumed them. The face they carved was wrong. But they kept trying."

**Class-Specific:**
- **Oathsworn:** "The Order would want you to destroy it. The Order doesn't know everything." (Destroying gives extra reward)
- **Knight:** "The crest on its base... House Korrath. Varric's family made this." (Additional lore revealed)

---

### Mysterious Fountain
*Water that flows upward, into nothing. It tastes like memory.*

**Base Choice:**
> "The fountain offers... something. Drink?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Drink Deep** | Random major effect (heal full, gain relic, OR lose 25% max HP) | *"The water is memories. Not yours. You taste a wedding. A betrayal. A death. A birth. All at once."* |
| **Sip Carefully** | Heal 20 HP | *"Just a sip. Just a taste. Just someone else's childhood, fading on your tongue."* |
| **Bottle It** | Gain 1 Potion | *"The water fights the bottle. It doesn't want to be contained. It never did."* |

**On Drink Deep (Random Lore Flashes):**
- "You see a woman in a crown, weeping."
- "You taste smoke. A kingdom burning."
- "You feel what it's like to forget your own name."
- "For one moment, you ARE the Warden. Then you're yourself again. Barely."

**Class-Specific:**
- **Cleric:** "This water blessed by my god... no. MY god blessed this water. Before they were MY god." (Guaranteed good outcome)
- **Fey-Touched:** "The water tastes like fairy wine. Oberon's been here." (Outcome influenced by Luck)

### Memory Well
*A well that leads nowhere. Or everywhere. Drop something in and see what rises.*

> "The well asks for a memory. What will you forget?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **A Happy Memory** | Lose 5 max HP, gain random rare relic | *"You forget a smile. Someone's face. Were they important? You'll never know now."* |
| **A Painful Memory** | Remove a curse from deck, add 1 Pain | *"The pain goes. The lesson remains—scarred into you."* |
| **Look Without Giving** | See a vision of your class's backstory | *"You see your past. Your reasons. Your first mistake."* |

**Vision Outcomes (Look Without Giving):**
- **Cleric:** "You see your god, walking toward the Sanctum. Willing. Resolved. Alone."
- **Knight:** "You see Ser Aldric at the gate. Hesitating. Then stepping through."
- **Diabolist:** "You see yourself, signing the contract. Xan'thrax's smile. Your own hands, shaking."
- **Oathsworn:** "You see the Order's founder, weeping at the Sanctum's entrance. They saw what you'll see."
- **Fey-Touched:** "You see the fairy ring. Yourself, falling asleep. Oberon, watching. Choosing."

## Act 2 Shrines: Corruption and Bargains

### The Drowned Shrine
*Water fills this room, but you can breathe. The pressure is memory.*

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|

| **Drain the Shrine** | Lose 20 HP, the Drowned King fight becomes easier | *"The waters recede. Aldric feels it. He's weaker now—and angrier."* |

**Warden's Whisper:**

| **A Secret** | Reveal your class's hidden weakness to the Hollow God | Gain a unique relic that nullifies that weakness |

**Merchant's Dialogue:**

**If Player Refuses All:**
> "A wise customer knows when not to buy. Or a cowardly one. Either way—I'll be here. Everyone comes back to the merchant."

---

### The Contract Table
*A table with three documents. All are blank until you touch them.*

**Base Choice:**

| **Contract of Protection** | Start each combat with 10 block | Deal 15% less damage |
| **Contract of Knowledge** | See enemy intents 2 turns ahead | Lose 2 max HP after each combat |

**Diabolist-Specific:**
> "These contracts were written by Xan'thrax. Signing one counts as progress toward your deal—but he doesn't tell you which clause."
>
> Additional option: "Tear up the contracts" — Xan'thrax's whispers increase, but you gain 10 max HP. He's furious.

## Act 3 Shrines: Sacrifice and Purpose

> "Theron the Builder, 1,247 years: 'Don't let it take your name first. Protect your name.'"
>
> "Mara of the Dawn, 892 years: 'Love doesn't weaken you. Love is the anchor.'"

### The Hollow Altar
*An altar that absorbs light. Standing here, you feel less.*

**Base Choice:**
> "The Hollow God offers peace. Real peace. Do you want it?"

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Accept a Piece of Emptiness** | Max HP reduced by 10, but immune to fear/debuff effects | *"A piece of you becomes void. It doesn't hurt. Nothing hurts anymore."* |
| **Offer Your Doubt** | Remove all Curses from deck, but cannot heal for 3 combats | *"Your uncertainty dissolves. You feel... sure. Too sure. Is this peace or erasure?"* |
| **Reject the Offer** | Take 20 damage, gain "Defiant Spirit" relic (+5 damage vs Hollow God) | *"You say no. It hurts. The Hollow God is confused. No one says no. Not here."* |

**If Reject:**
The Hollow God's voice echoes:
> "Interesting. You refuse peace. You choose struggle. Why?"
>
> *[No answer required. Your refusal IS the answer.]*

---

### The Final Shrine (Pre-Boss)
*No altar. No water. Just a mirror. And the Warden.*

**The Warden's Final Gift:**
> "I have nothing left to give you. Except... this."

| Choice | Effect | Flavor Text |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Accept the Warden's Blessing** | Full heal, +10 max HP for this fight only | *"The Warden touches your forehead. For one moment, you see what they saw. Then they smile, and the vision fades."* |
| **Refuse, Give the Warden Peace** | No mechanical benefit, but Warden's death dialogue changes | *"You give them what they need: permission to rest. 'Thank you,' they whisper. 'I was so tired.'"* |
| **Ask the Warden's Name** | Learn the Warden's true identity; gain unique card | *"They pause. 'I... was...' The name comes slowly. 'I was Lyra. I think. Yes. Lyra.'"* |

**The Warden's True Name (Secret):**
Lyra of the Silver Dawn—a Cleric who entered 347 years ago, seeking to heal the Sanctum itself. She failed. But she held.

**Class-Specific Connections:**
- **Cleric:** Lyra was a member of your order. Her prayer book is your prayer book.
- **Knight:** Lyra trained with the Sealed Gate. She was Ser Aldric's student.
- **Diabolist:** Lyra's sister made a deal with Xan'thrax. This is why Lyra entered—to find her.
- **Oathsworn:** Lyra's writings founded the Order of the Burning Truth. She would be horrified.
