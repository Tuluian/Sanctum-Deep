# Story 11.1: Class-Specific Bosses (Concept)

## Status: Draft (Concept Only)

## Story

**As a** player replaying with different classes,
**I want** bosses tailored to counter my class's strengths,
**so that** each class has unique challenges and replay value.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Document design concept for class-specific boss variants
2. Define how bosses would adapt to each class
3. Identify implementation approach (variants vs. modifiers)
4. Estimate effort for implementation
5. Prioritize which bosses/classes to start with
6. **Note: This is a concept/design story, not implementation**

## Design Concept

### Option A: Boss Variants
Create alternate versions of each boss per class:
- Bonelord vs Cleric: Anti-healing abilities
- Bonelord vs Knight: Shield-breaking attacks
- Bonelord vs Diabolist: Curse immunity

**Pros**: Deep customization, unique experiences
**Cons**: 8 classes × 3 bosses = 24 variants (content heavy)

### Option B: Boss Modifiers
Add class-reactive abilities to existing bosses:
- If player is Cleric: Boss gains "Unholy Presence" (healing reduced 50%)
- If player is Knight: Boss gains "Armor Piercer" (ignores some block)

**Pros**: Easier to implement, less content
**Cons**: Less dramatic difference

### Option C: Hybrid
- Keep base bosses the same
- Add 1-2 class-specific moves or passives
- Some classes trigger specific dialogue/story beats

## Class-Boss Counters (Conceptual)

| Class | Counter Mechanic | Narrative Reason |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Cleric | Anti-healing, Corruption | Faith vs Void |
| Knight | Block piercing, Stun | Discipline tested |
| Diabolist | Contract theft, Curse immunity | Demons recognize demons |
| Oathsworn | Vow breaking triggers | Oaths tested |
| Fey-Touched | Luck manipulation | Chaos vs Order |
| Celestial | Radiance drain | Light consumed |
| Summoner | Minion targeting | Divide and conquer |
| Bargainer | Favor theft | Deal manipulation |

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design review meeting (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Discuss options A, B, C
  - [ ] Choose approach
- [ ] Document detailed design (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Per-boss, per-class interactions
  - [ ] Narrative integration
- [ ] Effort estimation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Code changes required
  - [ ] Content creation required
- [ ] Prioritization (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Which classes first?
  - [ ] Which bosses first?
- [ ] Create follow-up implementation stories

## Dev Notes

### This is a CONCEPT story
- No code implementation
- Design and planning only
- Creates backlog items for actual work

### Implementation Considerations
- Could use enemy `phases` with class-conditional triggers
- Could add `classModifiers` to boss definitions
- Would need class detection in CombatEngine

### Lore Integration
The World Bible supports this—each class has unique relationship with bosses:
- Cleric seeks their god (was a Warden)
- Knight seeks mentor Aldric (crystallized)
- Each class has Lyra connection
