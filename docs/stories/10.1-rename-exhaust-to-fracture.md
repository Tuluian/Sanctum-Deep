# Story 10.1: Rename "Exhaust" to "Fracture"

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player of Sanctum Ruins,
**I want** the card removal mechanic to be called "Fracture" instead of "Exhaust",
**so that** our game has unique terminology that fits the lore (and avoids Slay the Spire confusion).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All instances of "Exhaust" renamed to "Fracture" in code
2. All UI text shows "Fracture" instead of "Exhaust"
3. Card descriptions use "Fracture" terminology
4. Tooltip/help text explains what Fracture means
5. Alternative names considered: "Exile" or "Forget" (Hollow God thematic)
6. Codebase search confirms no remaining "exhaust" references (gameplay context)

## Naming Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Fracture** | Fits world (shattered memories), unique | Less intuitive |
| **Exile** | Common CCG term, clear meaning | Used by other games (MTG) |
| **Forget** | Perfect Hollow God tie-in | Might confuse with Forget attack |

**Recommendation**: Use **"Fracture"** - unique to Sanctum, fits the shattered/broken theme

## Dev Notes

### Lore Justification
In Sanctum Ruins, identity and memory are fragile. When a card is "Fractured," you're not just discarding it—you're temporarily losing a piece of your fighting capability, like a memory slipping away in the presence of the Hollow God.

### Technical Scope
- Type rename: `isExhaust` → `isFracture`, etc.
- Variable rename: `exhaustPile` → `fracturePile`
- UI string changes
- Card description changes

### Relevant Files
- `src/types/index.ts` - effect types
- `src/engine/CombatEngine.ts` - exhaust pile logic
- `src/data/cards/**/*.ts` - card descriptions
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - UI labels

### Testing
- Full game playthrough to verify no "exhaust" text appears
- Unit tests still pass after rename
