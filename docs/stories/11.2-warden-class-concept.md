# Story 11.2: The Warden Class (Post-MVP Concept)

## Status: Draft (Concept Only)

## Story

**As a** player who completed the game and chose to become the Warden,
**I want** to play as a new "Warden" class with unique support mechanics,
**so that** my choice has lasting gameplay impact and I can experience a new playstyle.

## Concept Overview

After defeating the Hollow God and choosing to become the Warden, players unlock a new class: **The Warden**. This class inverts the normal gameplay—instead of fighting through the dungeon yourself, you **supervise and support another spirit** attempting the dungeon.

### Core Fantasy
> *"You are now the guardian of the Sanctum. Your role is to help worthy souls reach you—and the Hollow God—while maintaining the balance that keeps the void contained."*

## Unique Mechanics

### The Champion System
- You always have an AI-controlled **Champion** (minion) fighting for you
- If the Champion dies, **you lose the run**
- You play **support cards** to heal, buff, and protect your Champion
- Your Champion deals the damage; you enable their success

### Warden Powers
- **Memory Echoes**: Cards that replay effects from your previous runs
- **Sanctum Control**: Manipulate the battlefield (add hazards for enemies, shields for Champion)
- **Identity Lending**: Temporarily boost Champion with fragments of your past classes

### Resource: **Vigil**
- Builds when Champion takes damage (you're watching over them)
- Spend Vigil on powerful intervention cards
- Max Vigil = 10, resets each combat

## Acceptance Criteria (Design Phase)

1. Document complete class fantasy and mechanics
2. Design starter deck (10 cards)
3. Design 30-card pool (common, uncommon, rare)
4. Define Champion AI behavior
5. Design unique relics for Warden
6. Create narrative integration (how unlock works)
7. **Note: This is post-MVP, concept only**

## Starter Deck Concept

| Card | Cost | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| **Guide** | 1 | Champion attacks for 6 damage |
| **Shield the Worthy** | 1 | Champion gains 5 Block |
| **Mend** | 1 | Heal Champion for 5 HP |
| **Warden's Watch** | 0 | Gain 1 Vigil. Draw 1 card |

## Card Pool Ideas

### Common
- **Sanctum's Blessing**: Heal Champion 8 HP
- **Echo Strike**: Champion attacks for 8 damage
- **Memory Shield**: Champion gains 8 Block
- **Vigilant Eye**: Gain 2 Vigil

### Uncommon
- **Guardian Intervention**: Spend 3 Vigil. Negate the next attack on Champion
- **Past Life**: Play a random card from a previous class you've beaten the game with
- **Sanctum Thorns**: Enemies take 3 damage when they attack Champion

### Rare
- **Lyra's Legacy**: Champion gains all your current Block. You lose all Block
- **The Line Holds**: If Champion would die, prevent it and heal to 1 HP. Fracture this card
- **True Warden**: For this combat, Champion's damage is doubled

## Unlock Condition

1. Beat the game with any class
2. Choose "Become the Warden" ending
3. Warden class unlocks for future runs
4. Narrative: "Centuries pass. Another soul enters the Sanctum. You watch. You wait. You help."

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design document: class mechanics (AC: 1)
- [ ] Design document: starter deck (AC: 2)
- [ ] Design document: full card pool (AC: 3)
- [ ] Design document: Champion AI (AC: 4)
- [ ] Design document: relics (AC: 5)
- [ ] Narrative integration document (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create implementation stories (future)

## Dev Notes

### This is a POST-MVP CONCEPT
- Requires significant new systems (Champion AI, Vigil resource)
- Should be implemented after core 8 classes are complete
- Consider as paid DLC or major update

### Inspiration
- Similar to some minion-based classes in other deckbuilders
- Unique twist: you're the "dungeon" now, helping the hero
- Meta-narrative: player literally becomes what they conquered

### Technical Considerations
- Champion needs AI to choose attacks
- Champion targeting logic
- Vigil resource system
- "Past Life" cards need class history tracking

### Narrative Tie-In
From World Bible:
> *"Since Theron, there have been 27 Wardens. Each one entered the Sanctum, defeated or survived its trials, and chose to take up the vigil."*

The player becomes Warden #28 (or the final Warden, depending on True Ending).
