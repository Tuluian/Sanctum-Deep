# Story 7.11: Class-Specific Card Color Schemes

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player using different character classes,
**I want** cards to have distinct color schemes based on my class,
**so that** each class feels visually unique and cards are easily identifiable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each class has a distinct card color palette
2. Card backgrounds reflect class colors
3. Card borders/accents match class theme
4. Text remains readable against class colors
5. Color schemes applied to all card views (hand, rewards, deck)
6. Universal/neutral cards have a distinct "neutral" color scheme

## Color Palettes (from Character-Image-Prompts.txt)

| Class | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Cleric** | Gold | White, Cream | Soft Amber |
| **Dungeon Knight** | Steel Blue | Iron Grey | Brass |
| **Diabolist** | Crimson | Black | Ember Orange |
| **Oathsworn** | White | Gold | Pale Blue |
| **Fey-Touched** | Emerald | Violet | Dreamlike Pastels |
| **Celestial** | Pure Gold | Radiant White | Prismatic Light |
| **Summoner** | Spirit Blue | Deep Purple | Silver, Spectral Green |
| **Bargainer** | Rich Gold | Blood Red | Shadow Black |

## Dev Notes

### Design Reference
See `/NOTES/Character-Image-Prompts.txt` for detailed color palettes and design direction for each class.

### Implementation Approach
1. Add `classId` or `classColors` to card rendering
2. Apply CSS class based on card's owner class
3. CSS handles the visual differentiation

### Relevant Files
- `src/styles/main.css` - card styling
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - card rendering
- `src/data/classes.ts` - class definitions

### Testing
- Visual review of all class cards
- Ensure readability in all lighting/states
