   ```
   "appbuild"
   {
     "appid" "YOUR_APP_ID"
     "desc" "Sanctum Ruins v1.0.0"
     "buildoutput" ".\output\"
     "contentroot" ".\content\"
     "setlive" "default"
     "preview" "0"
     "local" ""
     "depots"
     {
       "YOUR_DEPOT_ID"
       {
         "FileMapping"
         {
           "LocalPath" "*"
           "DepotPath" "."
           "recursive" "1"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
