## Dev Notes

### Warden Choice Implementation
```typescript
function onHollowGodDefeated(): void {
  showNarrativeSequence([
    { speaker: 'narrator', text: 'The void recedes. Silence falls.' },
    { speaker: 'warden', text: 'It is done. The seal holds... for now.' },
    { speaker: 'warden', text: 'Now... the choice.' },
  ]);

  const canDestroySeal = hasBeatenWithAllClasses();

  showChoice({
    title: 'The Final Choice',
    options: [
      {
        id: 'become_warden',
        label: 'Become the Warden',
        description: 'Take up the mantle. Guard the Sanctum for eternity.',
        always_available: true,
      },
      {
        id: 'destroy_seal',
        label: 'Destroy the Seal',
        description: 'End the cycle. Face the consequences together.',
        available: canDestroySeal,
        lockedMessage: 'Prove yourself with all five souls first.',
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

### UI Corruption Levels
```typescript
enum CorruptionLevel {
  NONE = 0,      // Normal display
  WHISPERS = 1,  // Occasional flickers
  CONSUMING = 2, // Blur, letter swaps
  ANNIHILATION = 3, // Nearly unreadable
}

function getCorruptionLevel(bossPhase: number): CorruptionLevel {
  return bossPhase as CorruptionLevel;
}
```

### Shrine Cleansing
```typescript
interface ShrineOption {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  effect: () => void;
}

const CLEANSE_CORRUPTION: ShrineOption = {
  id: 'cleanse_corruption',
  name: 'Cleanse Corruption',
  description: 'Remove corruption from all cards in your deck.',
  effect: () => {
    gameState.corruptedCardIds.clear();
    addLog('The shrine\'s light purifies your corrupted memories.');
  },
};
```

## Testing

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Warden Choice appears after Hollow God defeat
2. Both choice options work correctly
3. Shrine cleansing removes all corruption
4. Draw penalty applies at 5+ corrupted cards
5. UI corruption matches boss phase
6. Timer pauses correctly during animations
7. Shadow Self has correct visual appearance

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)

### Debug Log References
- All 808 tests passing after implementation

### Completion Notes List
1. **Boss HP Bar with Phase Markers**: Added massive 200px wide blood-red HP bar for Hollow God with golden gradient phase markers at 70% (Phase 2: Consumption) and 32% (Phase 3: Annihilation). Implemented via CSS class `.hollow-god-hp` with `.phase-marker` overlays positioned by percentage.

2. **Forget Visual Effect**: Created dramatic screen overlay with radial gradient darkening and card dissolve animation. Shows "You forget how to... [card name]" text that fades and dissolves. Triggered on CARD_PERMANENTLY_EXHAUSTED event. Animation lasts 1.5 seconds.

3. **Corruption Draw Penalty**: Added logic to CombatEngine.startPlayerTurn() that reduces draw count by 1 when player has 5+ corrupted cards (corruptedCardIds.size >= 5). Log message warns player when penalty is active.

4. **Warden Choice**: Verified already implemented in victory-defeat-screens story - no additional work needed.

### File List
- `src/styles/main.css` - Added `.hollow-god-hp`, `.phase-marker`, `.forget-effect`, `.forget-card-dissolve` CSS
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - Added phase marker HTML in enemy HP bars, `playForgetAnimation()` method
- `src/engine/CombatEngine.ts` - Added corruption draw penalty logic in `startPlayerTurn()`
- `src/main.ts` - Added CARD_PERMANENTLY_EXHAUSTED event handler to trigger forget animation
