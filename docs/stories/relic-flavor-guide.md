# Relic Flavor Text Guide

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player discovering relics throughout the Sanctum,
**I want** each item to tell a story of who owned it and what happened to them,
**so that** even equipment carries emotional weight and world-building.

---

## Narrative Context: What Remains

> *"The Sanctum doesn't just consume souls. It collects keepsakes. Every relic was held by someone who failed. Every benefit it provides was bought with someone's last breath."*

### Design Philosophy

Relics should feel like:
- Personal possessions with history
- Warnings from those who came before
- Power at a cost—someone paid already
- Connections to named NPCs and events

### Relic Naming Convention

| Category | Naming Pattern | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Personal Items | "X's [Object]" | "Eliza's Locket," "Aldric's Crown" |
| Blessed Objects | Religious/sacred terms | "Silver Flame Pendant," "Consecrated Stone" |
| Cursed Objects | Dark/ominous terms | "Hollow Shard," "Void-Touched Amulet" |
| Ancient Artifacts | Historical/mysterious | "First Warden's Key," "Thalassar Crest" |

## Relic Categories

### Starter Relics (Class-Specific)

Each class begins with a relic that tells part of their backstory.

#### Cleric: Elara's Prayer Book

**Effect:** Start each combat with 1 Devotion

**Flavor Text:**
> *"My mentor gave me this before I entered. 'Faith is a muscle,' she said. 'Exercise it daily.'"*
>
> *The pages are worn. The binding is cracked. But the prayers still read.*
>
> *"I wonder if she knows I'm here. I wonder if she prays for me."*

**On Pick Up (not starting):** *"This belonged to another Cleric. The prayers are different from mine. But the faith... the faith feels the same."*

---

#### Knight: Ser Aldric's Seal

**Effect:** +5 max HP

>
> *I've been carrying it ever since. It's time to return it—or find out why he never could.*

## Warden's Commentary

When the player picks up certain relics, the Warden may comment:

### On First Relic Pickup
> "Ah. You've found your first keepsake. Every item here was held by someone who failed."
>
> "Don't mourn them. Use what they left. That's the only honor they have now."

### On Boss Relics
> "That belonged to them. The ones who ruled here before becoming prisoners."
>
> "Take it. They don't need it anymore. They don't need anything anymore."

### On Cursed Relics
> "Be careful with that. Some items remember their owners too well."
>
> "The power is real. So is the cost. Make sure you can pay."

### On Finding Class-Specific Relics (Other Classes)
