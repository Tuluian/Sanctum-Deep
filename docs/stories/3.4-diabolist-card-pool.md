# Story 3.4: Diabolist Card Pool

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** Diabolist player,
**I want** a full pool of infernal cards to discover during my run,
**so that** I can build diverse decks around Contracts, self-damage, and curse management.

---

## Narrative Context: The Language of Contracts

> *"Every card in my deck is a clause in a contract I didn't fully read. The power is real. The price? We'll see."*

### Card Design Philosophy

Diabolist cards should feel like:
- Legal documents with teeth
- Desperate bargains with infernal entities
- Power that comes at a cost—always at a cost
- Dark humor about mortality and deals

### Mordecai's Voice

Cards reflect Mordecai's sardonic personality. Even the darkest abilities have a hint of gallows humor. They're dying. They know it. They might as well laugh.

### Card Naming Convention

| Theme | Naming Pattern | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Contracts | Legal/business terms | "Debt Transfer," "Soul Bankruptcy," "Terms of Service" |
| Self-damage | Blood/sacrifice imagery | "Blood Offering," "Ritual Sacrifice," "Bloodletting" |
| Curses | Dark religious terms | "Torment," "Damnation," "Excommunication" |
| Power | Infernal hierarchy | "Infernal," "Demonic," "Hellfire" |

## Card Flavor Text Guide

### Starter Deck Flavor

| Card | Flavor Text |
|------|-------------|
| **Soul Rend** | *"The screaming stops eventually. You stop hearing it before that."* |
| **Dark Bargain** | *"The contract specified 'protection.' It didn't specify from what."* |
| **Blood Pact** | *"Xan'thrax promised power. He didn't mention the interest rate."* |
| **Hellfire** | *"I learned this from a devil. He learned it from something worse."* |

### Common Card Flavor

| **Sacrificial Strike** | *"My blood opens doors. Other people's blood opens more."* |
| **Dark Shield** | *"Safety comes at a cost. Safety always comes at a cost."* |

| **Infernal Bolt** | *"No strings attached. That should worry you."* |
| **Torment** | *"Pain is a language. I'm fluent."* |
| **Blood Offering** | *"Knowledge costs. You'll pay now or later. Probably both."* |
| **Cursed Strength** | *"My curses make me stronger. That's... actually concerning."* |
| **Grim Harvest** | *"Their death feeds my life. Circle of... something."* |
| **Demonic Guard** | *"The more damned I am, the harder I am to kill. There's a metaphor there."* |

| **Bloodletting** | *"Healing through bleeding. Medicine has come so far."* |

### Uncommon Card Flavor

| Card | Flavor Text |
|------|-------------|
| **Infernal Contract** | *"Sign here, here, and here. Don't read the fine print. It reads you."* |
| **Soul Furnace** | *"My pain becomes their pain. At least it's good for something."* |
| **Debt Transfer** | *"Your debt now. Good luck with the creditor."* |
| **Ritual Sacrifice** | *"The ritual requires blood. It's not picky about whose."* |
| **Demonic Form** | *"I'm becoming something else. Something with better damage output."* |
| **Curse Eater** | *"Curses are just... spicy blessings. Very spicy."* |
| **Bargain with Death** | *"Death and I have an understanding. I keep paying; it keeps waiting."* |
| **Infernal Pact** | *"Power in exchange for my health. Standard contractor terms."* |

### Rare Card Flavor

| Card | Flavor Text |
|------|-------------|
| **Soul Shatter** | *"Everything I am, weaponized. Hope they appreciate it."* |
| **Lord of Contracts** | *"I've read enough fine print to find the loopholes."* |
| **Final Sacrifice** | *"One HP. All the damage. Xan'thrax would call this dramatic."* |

---

## Curse Flavor Text

| Curse | Flavor Text |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pain** | *"A reminder. Xan'thrax wants you to remember who you serve."* |
| **Weakness** | *"Your strength, borrowed. Your debt, permanent."* |
| **Doom** | *"The clock is ticking. It always was."* |
| **Torment** | *"The contract never ends. The pain never stops. Read the fine print."* |

## Xan'thrax's Whispers (Soul Debt Triggers)

As Soul Debt increases, the devil makes his presence known:

### Soul Debt 5+
- *"You're doing so well, little mageling..."*
- *"The fragment is close. I can smell it on you."*
- *"Remember our bargain. Remember who saved you."*

### Soul Debt 10+
- *"Almost there. So close. Don't fail me now."*
- *"Your soul is... ripening. Yes, that's the word."*
- *"The other delvers tasted like despair. You taste like ambition."*

### Soul Debt 15+
- *"I can see through your eyes sometimes. Nice view."*
- *"Your heartbeat syncs with mine. Romantic, isn't it?"*
- *"Fight harder. I have plans for you. After."*

### Soul Debt 20+
- *"BRING ME WHAT IS MINE."*
- *"I am patient. I am eternal. You are neither."*
- *"Every soul you consume belongs to ME."*

## Dev Notes

### Diabolist Archetypes

**Self-Damage Build**:
- Soul Furnace, Sacrificial Strike, Bloodletting
- Convert HP into damage and effects

**Curse Synergy Build**:
- Cursed Strength, Demonic Guard, Debt Collector
- Embrace Curses for scaling damage

**Contract Build**:
- Infernal Contract, Demonic Form, Infernal Pact
- Powerful sustained effects with drawbacks

### Curse Definitions

```typescript
const CURSES: Record<string, CardDefinition> = {
  pain: {
    id: 'pain',
    name: 'Pain',
    type: CardType.CURSE,
    cost: 0,
    description: 'Unplayable. When drawn, lose 1 HP.',
    unplayable: true,
    onDraw: [{ type: EffectType.LOSE_HP, amount: 1 }]
  },
  weakness: {
    id: 'weakness',
    name: 'Weakness',
    type: CardType.CURSE,
    cost: 0,
    description: 'Unplayable. Deal 25% less damage this combat.',
    unplayable: true,
    onDraw: [{ type: EffectType.APPLY_STATUS, status: 'IMPAIRED', duration: 999 }]
  },
  doom: {
    id: 'doom',
    name: 'Doom',
    type: CardType.CURSE,
    cost: 0,
    description: 'Unplayable. At end of combat, lose 5 max HP.',
    unplayable: true,
    onCombatEnd: [{ type: EffectType.LOSE_MAX_HP, amount: 5 }]
  },
  torment: {
    id: 'torment',
    name: 'Torment',
    type: CardType.CURSE,
    cost: 0,
    description: 'Unplayable. Lose 1 HP at end of each turn.',
    unplayable: true,
    onTurnEnd: [{ type: EffectType.LOSE_HP, amount: 1 }]
  }
};
```

### Curse Counting

```typescript
function countCursesInDeck(): number {
  const allCards = [
    ...player.hand,
    ...player.drawPile,
    ...player.discardPile
  ];
  return allCards.filter(c => c.type === CardType.CURSE).length;
}

// Example: Cursed Strength
// Deal damage equal to Curses × 3
function executeCursedStrength(): void {
  const curses = countCursesInDeck();
  const damage = curses * 3;
  dealDamageToEnemy(target, damage);
}
```

### Balance Notes

| Card Type | Self-Damage | Curse Added | Power Level |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Common | 1-3 HP | 0-1 Pain | Moderate |
| Uncommon | 3-5 HP | 1-2 Curses | High |
| Rare | 5+ HP | 2-3 Curses | Extreme |

Risk increases with rarity. Rare cards are devastating but costly.

## Testing

### Test File Location
`src/tests/cards/DiabolistCards.test.ts`

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Self-Damage**: Cards correctly reduce player HP
2. **Curse Add**: Curses go to correct pile
3. **Curse Count**: Scaling effects count correctly
4. **Curse Exhaust**: Exhausting Curse triggers bonuses
5. **Contract**: Effect persists until condition
6. **Multiple Curses**: Different Curse types work independently
