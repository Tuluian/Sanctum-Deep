# Story 7.9: Enemy HP Bar Positioning Fix

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player fighting the Bonelord (and other large enemies),
**I want** enemy HP bars to appear above the unit with appropriately sized text,
**so that** I can clearly see enemy health without visual obstruction.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. HP bars render above enemy units, not behind them
2. HP bar z-index is higher than enemy sprite
3. HP text font size is appropriately scaled (smaller for large enemies)
4. HP bars remain visible for all enemy sizes
5. HP bars don't overlap with enemy intent icons
6. Consistent positioning across all enemy types

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Fix HP bar z-index (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Increase z-index for HP bar container
  - [ ] Verify renders above enemy sprite
- [ ] Adjust HP bar positioning (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Calculate proper Y offset based on enemy size
  - [ ] Position above sprite bounding box
- [ ] Scale HP text font (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Reduce font size for better fit
  - [ ] Ensure readability at new size
- [ ] Avoid intent overlap (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Check intent icon positioning
  - [ ] Adjust if needed
- [ ] Test all enemy types (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Small enemies (Imp, Slime)
  - [ ] Medium enemies (most common)
  - [ ] Large enemies (Bonelord, bosses)

## Dev Notes
