# Story 7.10: Boss Phase Narrative Display

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player fighting boss enemies,
**I want** narrative dialogue to appear on screen during phase transitions,
**so that** boss fights feel dramatic and story moments are communicated.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase transition triggers narrative display
2. Narrative text appears in a readable overlay/banner
3. Text is styled dramatically (boss-appropriate theme)
4. Display lasts 2-3 seconds before fading
5. Combat pauses briefly during narrative display
6. Works for all bosses: Bonelord (3 phases), Drowned King (2 phases), Hollow God (3 phases)
7. Phase-specific dialogue is pulled from boss definition

## Dev Notes

### Narrative Sources
Already defined in boss files:
- `src/data/enemies/act1-boss.ts` - BONELORD_DIALOGUE
- `src/data/enemies/act2-boss.ts` - DROWNED_KING_DIALOGUE
- `src/data/enemies/act3-boss.ts` - HOLLOW_GOD_DIALOGUE

### Phase Entry Dialogue Examples
- Bonelord Phase 2: "Your persistence... I remember this feeling. When I still had hope."
- Hollow God Phase 2: "Your name... I'm forgetting it already. So will you."

### Relevant Files
- `src/engine/CombatEngine.ts` - phase transition detection
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - narrative display
- `src/styles/main.css` - narrative overlay styling

### Testing
- Test each boss phase transition
- Verify correct dialogue displayed
