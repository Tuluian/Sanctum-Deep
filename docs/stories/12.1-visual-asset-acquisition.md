## Dev Notes

### Current State
- Enemies are emoji: 💀, 🧙, 👻, etc.
- Cards are styled divs with text
- UI is functional but plain

### Art Direction Reference
See `/NOTES/Character-Image-Prompts.txt` for detailed style guide:
- Gothic-fantasy tone
- Melancholy but elegant
- Bold silhouettes, vector-style

### Gemini Note
From notes: "Gemini is CRAZY for making enemy vectors!!!! HOWEVER... usage only resets every 24 hours"
Consider using Gemini for custom vector generation.

### Relevant Files
- `public/assets/` - asset storage
- `src/ui/renderer.ts` - rendering
- `src/styles/main.css` - styling

### Budget Considerations
- Free assets first
- Paid assets for key visuals (bosses, class portraits)
- Custom commission for unique assets (future)
