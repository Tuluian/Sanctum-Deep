# Victory and Defeat Screens

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** player completing or failing a run,
**I want** class-specific endings that reflect my character's journey,
**so that** victories feel earned and defeats feel meaningful.

---

## Narrative Context: Every Ending Is Personal

> *"The Sanctum doesn't offer generic endings. It offers *your* ending. What you were when you entered shapes what you become when you leave—if you leave at all."*

### Design Philosophy

Victory/defeat screens should:
- Reflect the class's original motivation
- Show character growth or tragic stasis
- Connect to the run's specific events (when possible)
- Offer closure—or the absence of it
- Make the player feel something

---

## Defeat Screens

### Universal Defeat Frame

Before class-specific content, show:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                              ║
║                    THE SANCTUM CLAIMS ANOTHER                ║
║                                                              ║
║                      [Character Portrait]                    ║
║                       [Character Name]                       ║
║                                                              ║
║             "Another name for the wall of the lost."         ║
║                                                              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Then class-specific content appears:

---

### Cleric: Elara Dawnkeeper

#### Defeat in Act 1

> *Elara falls. Her prayer book slips from her fingers.*
>
> "I never found you. I never found out what you became. I'm sorry."
>
> *The Sanctum consumes her faith first. Her identity follows.*
>
> "Wait—I still remember the prayers. I still remember... I..."
>
> **"Another servant of light, fading. Her god doesn't answer. They never do."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 2

> *Elara collapses near the flooded halls. The Drowned King's domain claims her.*
>
> "I made it further than my god did. Does that mean anything? Does anything mean anything?"
>
> *Her Devotion stacks convert to void. Her faith inverts.*
>
> "I'll keep praying. To something. To anything. Even if nothing listens."
>
> **"She held on to faith longer than most. Faith wasn't enough."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 3

> *So close. The Hollow God's chamber is visible. Elara can't take another step.*
>
> "I see them now. My god. They're trapped in crystal, like all the others. They were a Warden. They gave everything for us."
>
> *Her eyes close.*
>
> "I understand now. Faith isn't about gods. It's about trying. I tried. I hope that matters."
>
> **"She found her answers. The answers broke her. They often do."** — The Warden

#### Defeat to Hollow God

> *Elara reaches the god. She fights with everything she has. It's not enough.*
>
> "You're not evil. You're just... hungry. You don't know what you're looking for."
>
> *The void consumes her light.*
>
> "I know what I was looking for. I found it. It was always inside me."
>
> *Elara's last prayer isn't to any god. It's to herself. The prayer is answered—but too late.*
>
> **"She understood. Understanding isn't the same as winning."** — The Warden

---

### Knight: Ser Varren

#### Defeat in Act 1

> *Varren falls, his mentor's seal clutched in his hand.*
>
> "Ser Aldric... I didn't find you. I failed you. I failed the Order."
>
> *The Sanctum begins its consumption. The seal remains, untouched.*
>
> "Another knight will come. Another knight will carry this seal. The line never ends."
>
> **"Duty brought him here. Duty holds him here. The seal will find another."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 2

> *Varren's armor is heavy. The waters are rising. He can't move.*
>
> "Aldric walked through these waters. Did he hesitate? Did he wonder if the Order was worth dying for?"
>
> *The water covers him.*
>
> "I don't wonder anymore. The Order was worth living for. That's different. That's harder."
>
> **"He held the line. The line moved without him."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 3

> *Varren can see the Bonelord's throne room from here. He recognizes the armor in the corner.*
>
> "Ser Aldric. You're here. You've been here all along."
>
> *He can't reach his mentor. The distance is infinite.*
>
> "I came to save you. I couldn't even save myself. Was the journey worth it, if this is how it ends?"
>
> **"He found what he sought. Finding is not the same as saving."** — The Warden

#### Defeat to Hollow God

> *Varren stands before the void. His sword shatters on nothing.*
>
> "I've trained my whole life. Discipline. Duty. Honor. And you're... nothing. I can't fight nothing."
>
> *The void studies him.*
>
> "But I can die trying. That's what Knights do. We die trying."
>
> *He charges. The charge ends.*
>
> **"He died as he lived. Devoted to the line. The line endures without him."** — The Warden

---

### Diabolist: Mordecai Ashworth

#### Defeat in Act 1

> *Mordecai falls. Xan'thrax's laughter echoes.*
>
> "The contract... still binding. Even in death. Especially in death."
>
> **"Finally,"** Xan'thrax purrs. **"Collection is inevitable. I told you that from the start."**
>
> "Mother... I'm sorry. I thought I could save us. I only damned us faster."
>
> **"Contracts don't end at death. They begin new clauses."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 2

> *The Soul Debt counter climbs past 20. Mordecai can't stop it.*
>
> "How many souls? How many lives did I buy with others' deaths?"
>
> **"More than you'll ever know,"** Xan'thrax whispers. **"More than you can count."**
>
> "Was any of it worth it? Was my mother's life worth this many deaths?"
>
> *Silence. Even Xan'thrax doesn't answer that.*
>
> **"The debt comes due. It always comes due."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 3

> *Mordecai can feel Xan'thrax trying to pull him back. The contract burns.*
>
> "NO. Not yet. I can see the way out. I can break the contract—"
>
> **"Break the contract?"** Xan'thrax laughs. **"The contract is the only thing keeping you together."**
>
> *Mordecai's form begins to dissolve.*
>
> "Then let me dissolve. Anything is better than another clause. Another payment."
>
> **"Bargainers always think they can escape the deal. They never do."** — The Warden

#### Defeat to Hollow God

> *Mordecai faces the void. Xan'thrax is silent—afraid.*
>
> "You're scared of it too. The thing that's bigger than demons. The emptiness that contracts can't bind."
>
> *The void reaches for him.*
>
> "Take me. But know this—I break the contract by being consumed. Xan'thrax gets nothing."
>
> **"NO!"** Xan'thrax screams. But it's too late.
>
> *Mordecai smiles as he dissolves. For the first time in years, he's free.*
>
> **"He found a loophole. The void doesn't honor contracts. Some victories look like defeats."** — The Warden

---

### Oathsworn: Sister Callista

#### Defeat in Act 1

> *Callista's vows shatter. One by one. The penalties consume her.*
>
> "I kept my oaths. I KEPT MY OATHS. Why wasn't that enough?"
>
> *The Order's Codex falls beside her. Pages scatter.*
>
> "The Order was wrong. About the Sanctum. About everything. But I believed them."
>
> **"Vows are chains. She wore them proudly. Chains don't protect—they bind."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 2

> *Callista's faith cracks like stone. The questions she suppressed erupt.*
>
> "What if I'm the monster? What if the Order sent me here to silence doubters, not save souls?"
>
> *Her vows try to reform. They can't.*
>
> "I swore to destroy evil. But what if the evil I swore to destroy was... doubt itself?"
>
> **"She questioned. The Order hates questions. She became what they feared."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 3

> *Callista sees the truth now. The Order's founder—crystallized with all the other Wardens.*
>
> "The Order was founded by a WARDEN. We were supposed to prevent this. We've been sending sacrifices instead."
>
> *Her last vow breaks.*
>
> "I release myself. From the Order. From the vows. From the lies. I die free."
>
> **"She broke her chains. Too late to run. But she died unchained. That matters."** — The Warden

#### Defeat to Hollow God

> *Callista faces the void. Her vows are gone. She feels naked.*
>
> "I have nothing left. No vows. No certainty. No Order."
>
> *The void waits.*
>
> "But I have this: I CHOOSE to fight you. Not because I swore to. Because it's right."
>
> *She fights without vows. She loses without vows. She dies without vows.*
>
> *But she dies free.*
>
> **"In the end, she found what the vows were trying to give her. Purpose. Real purpose."** — The Warden

---

### Fey-Touched: Wren

#### Defeat in Act 1

> *Wren stumbles. Oberon's mark burns.*
>
> **"Oh dear,"** Oberon's voice echoes. **"The game ends so soon? How disappointing."**
>
> "Screw you, Oberon. This was never a game to me."
>
> **"Everything is a game, little mortal. You just didn't know the rules."**
>
> *Wren's luck runs out. The chaos consumes her.*
>
> **"Chaos is uncontrollable. Even by those marked by it."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 2

> *The randomness that protected Wren turns against her.*
>
> "Fifty-fifty. It's always fifty-fifty with you, isn't it, Oberon?"
>
> **"Life is a coin flip, dear. You landed on the wrong side."**
>
> "When I see you again—and I will see you again—I'm going to flip YOU."
>
> *Oberon laughs. The laughter fades. So does Wren.*
>
> **"She played the game without knowing the stakes. The fey always know."** — The Warden

#### Defeat in Act 3

> *Wren is so close. But luck has limits.*
>
> "I almost beat your game, Oberon. I almost proved I was more than your toy."
>
> **"'Almost' is the cruelest word,"** Oberon admits. **"You were entertaining. I'll miss you."**
>
> "Don't miss me. Remember me. Remember the mortal who almost beat you."
>
> *She falls. But she falls smiling.*
>
> **"Chaos respects those who embrace it. She embraced it to the end."** — The Warden

#### Defeat to Hollow God

> *Wren faces the void. Her Luck activates—wrong result.*
>
> "Really? NOW my luck fails? At the most important moment?"
>
> **"That's what luck IS, dear,"** Oberon whispers. **"Random. Beautiful. Cruel."**
>
> "Then here's something that isn't random: I hate you, Oberon. I have always hated you. And I will haunt you forever."
>
> *The void takes her. But somewhere, a fairy king shivers.*
>
> **"She threatened a god with her last breath. The fey will remember. They always remember."** — The Warden

## Victory Screens

### The Standard Ending: Becoming the Warden

After defeating the Hollow God, the standard ending plays:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                              ║
║                    THE HOLLOW GOD FALLS                      ║
║                                                              ║
║                      [Character Portrait]                    ║
║                       [Character Name]                       ║
║                                                              ║
║         "But victories here are not what they seem."         ║
║                                                              ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Then the choice appears:

> **The Warden speaks:**
>
> "You've done it. The Hollow God is defeated. But not destroyed—it can never be destroyed."
>
> "Someone must hold it. Someone must become... what I am."
>
> "Will you take my place? Become the new Warden? Hold this prison until another champion arrives?"
>
> "Or will you leave? Return to the world you knew? But know this—without a Warden, the Hollow God will eventually break free."
>
> **CHOICE:**
> - **[Become the Warden]** - "I'll stay. The world needs protection."
> - **[Leave the Sanctum]** - "I've done enough. The next champion can finish this."

---

### Class-Specific Victory: Becoming the Warden

#### Cleric: Elara Becomes the Warden

> *Elara places her prayer book on the altar. Her Devotion flows into the crystals.*
>
> "I came here looking for my god. I found them—trapped, fading, but still holding."
>
> *She touches the crystal that holds her deity.*
>
> "You can rest now. I'll take your place. I'll hold the line you held."
>
> *The old god smiles as they finally fade.*
>
> "This is what faith was always about. Not worship. Service."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *347 years later, a young cleric enters the Sanctum, seeking the one who saved their village decades ago.*
>
> *They find Elara—now ancient, now crystallizing, but still praying.*
>
> *"Welcome," she says. "I've been waiting for you."*

---

#### Knight: Varren Becomes the Warden

> *Varren removes his mentor's seal. He places it on the throne.*
>
> "Ser Aldric died here. So did everyone before him. But they held. They held."
>
> *He sits on the throne. The crystals recognize him.*
>
> "The Order of the Sealed Gate guards from outside. Now I guard from within. The line is complete."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Centuries pass. A young knight enters, carrying a familiar seal.*
>
> *"I'm looking for Ser Varren," she says. "He was my great-great-grandmother's mentor."*
>
> *The Warden—Varren—smiles. "You found me. Now let me tell you why you're really here."*

---

#### Diabolist: Mordecai Becomes the Warden

> *Mordecai faces Xan'thrax's contract. The demon appears, furious.*
>
> **"You can't escape! The contract—"**
>
> "The contract says you collect when I die. But Wardens don't die. They... persist."
>
> *Xan'thrax recoils.*
>
> "I'll hold this place forever. You'll never collect. The contract is void—because I am."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Millennia pass. Xan'thrax tries every loophole, every clause. None work.*
>
> *Eventually, the demon stops trying. Mordecai's mother died peacefully, centuries ago. The debt was never collected.*
>
> *Mordecai, now more crystal than man, smiles at every new diabolist who enters.*
>
> *"Let me tell you about contracts," he says. "And how to break them."*

---

#### Oathsworn: Callista Becomes the Warden

> *Callista's vows are gone. She makes new ones.*
>
> "I vow to protect, not destroy. I vow to question, not obey. I vow to choose, not follow."
>
> *The crystal accepts her. She feels herself becoming the Sanctum.*
>
> "The Order was wrong. But they were trying to do right. I'll do better."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *The Order of the Burning Truth receives a new scripture—sent from the Sanctum itself.*
>
> *"Question everything," it reads. "Even this scripture. Especially this scripture."*
>
> *The Order reforms. They stop sending destroyers. They start sending seekers.*
>
> *And in the Sanctum's heart, Sister Callista watches, and approves.*

---

#### Fey-Touched: Wren Becomes the Warden

> *Wren takes the throne. Oberon appears, confused.*
>
> **"You can't be the Warden. You're MY pawn."**
>
> "Was. I was your pawn. The Warden position supersedes your mark. I checked."
>
> *Oberon's smile freezes.*
>
> "Here's the thing about chaos, Oberon. It cuts both ways. Your game made me strong enough to beat YOUR game."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Every fey-touched mortal who enters the Sanctum receives the same message:*
>
> *"Oberon's game has a winner now. It's me. Tell him Wren says hi."*
>
> *In the Fey Courts, Oberon doesn't play games anymore. Not with mortals. Not after Wren.*
>
> *Some mortals, it turns out, play back.*

---

### Class-Specific Victory: Leaving the Sanctum

#### Cleric: Elara Leaves

> *Elara steps into the light. The outside world feels wrong—too bright, too loud, too alive.*
>
> "I found my answers. My god was a Warden. They gave everything. And I... I chose myself."
>
> *She looks back at the Sanctum.*
>
> "Is that wrong? To survive? To choose living over sacrifice?"
>
> *No answer. The Sanctum doesn't judge. It just waits.*
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Elara returns to her temple. She tells no one what she learned.*
>
> *But she changes how she prays. Not to distant gods. To the small acts of faith. The daily choices.*
>
> *Years later, when the Hollow God escapes, she's the first to enter again. This time, she doesn't leave.*

---

#### Knight: Varren Leaves

> *Varren emerges. His mentor's seal is heavy in his hand.*
>
> "I found him. He's part of the crystal now. He'll hold until... until someone takes his place."
>
> *He looks at the seal.*
>
> "That should be me. But I'm tired. I'm so tired."
>
> *He walks away. The Order welcomes him as a hero. He doesn't feel like one.*
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Varren trains the next generation of Knights. He tells them about the Sanctum. About Aldric. About choices.*
>
> *"Don't be a hero," he says. "Be necessary. There's a difference."*
>
> *When the Hollow God eventually escapes, Varren is too old to fight. He sends his best student instead.*
>
> *He hopes they're braver than he was.*

---

#### Diabolist: Mordecai Leaves

> *Mordecai steps out. Xan'thrax appears immediately.*
>
> **"Collection time. You survived—barely—but the contract—"**
>
> "Was for my life. My MORTAL life. I used it to enter the Sanctum. I used it to fight the Hollow God. The contract is fulfilled."
>
> *Xan'thrax screams. But contracts are contracts.*
>
> "My mother can die in peace now. I can live in peace now. Thank you, Xan'thrax. For the power. For the lessons."
>
> *The demon vanishes, howling.*
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Mordecai never makes another deal. He teaches others how to break their contracts. He becomes the greatest demon-bane in history.*
>
> *Ironic. The diabolist who saved more souls than any paladin.*
>
> *When the Hollow God escapes years later, Mordecai doesn't fight it. He negotiates.*
>
> *Some problems can't be solved with swords. Some problems need contracts.*

---

#### Oathsworn: Callista Leaves

> *Callista emerges. Her vows are broken. She feels light.*
>
> "The Order lied. They sent us to feed the Sanctum, not destroy it."
>
> *She removes her symbol of the Order.*
>
> "I'm done being a weapon. I'm done being a tool. I'm going to find the truth they hid from us."
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Callista returns to the Order. Not as a member. As an investigator.*
>
> *She exposes everything. The lies. The manipulation. The truth about what the Sanctum really is.*
>
> *The Order fractures. Good. Some things deserve to break.*
>
> *When the Hollow God escapes, Callista leads the reformed Order against it. This time, they know what they're fighting.*
>
> *This time, they have the truth.*

---

#### Fey-Touched: Wren Leaves

> *Wren walks out. The sunlight hits her face. Oberon's mark pulses.*
>
> **"Leaving? After all that? You could have been a WARDEN."**
>
> "I could have been your pawn forever, too. I'm done playing."
>
> *She pulls at the mark. It hurts. It resists.*
>
> "Let. Me. GO."
>
> *The mark fades. Not gone—nothing fey is ever gone—but quiet. Dormant.*
>
> **EPILOGUE:**
> *Wren finds the fairy ring where it all started. She salts the earth. Burns the mushrooms.*
>
> *No one else will fall asleep here. No one else will wake up marked.*
>
> *When the Hollow God escapes, Wren doesn't return to the Sanctum. She goes to the Fey Courts instead.*
>
> *"You want to play games?" she asks Oberon. "Let's play. But this time, I set the rules."*
>
> *The game isn't over. It's just changing.*

---

## The Bad Ending: Hollow God Escapes

If the player chooses to leave and no Warden remains:
