# Story 6.3 Narrative: The Bargainer — Vesper Coin

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** player choosing the Bargainer class,
**I want** a rich narrative context that frames demon deals as morally complex rather than simply evil,
**so that** the Favor/Price mechanics carry emotional weight and my redemption arc feels earned.

---

## Narrative Context

> *"Every deal I ever made, someone lost. I was good at it. The best. And then I made a deal where I refused to win."*

**True Name:** Vesper, known in the underworld as "Vesper Coin" or "The Collector"

### The Gutter Rat

Vesper has no noble origin. No tragic backstory involving dead parents or stolen birthrights. She was born in the gutters of the capital city—same streets that spawned Ser Varren, though they never crossed paths.

She stole to survive. Lied to eat. Fought to sleep somewhere dry. By eight, she was running cons. By twelve, she was running crews. By fifteen, the **Syndicate**—the capital's criminal organization—recruited her.

Not as muscle. As *talent*.

Vesper could read people. Not magically—she wasn't touched by anything special. She just *saw* things. The way someone's eye twitched when they bluffed. The catch in their voice when they wanted something badly. The specific tilt of a head that meant "I'll pay double."

She became the Syndicate's closer. Their negotiator. Their Coin.

### The Devil's Deal

When Vesper was twenty-two, the Syndicate sent her to negotiate with a devil.

**Malachar the Broker** was an infernal entity who wanted a foothold in the mortal world. The Syndicate wanted access to demonic resources—information, artifacts, occasional muscle. A business partnership.

Vesper was supposed to secure favorable terms. She did better.

The contract she wrote was *perfect*. Every clause balanced. Every loophole closed. Every possible exploitation accounted for. Malachar read it seventeen times before signing, and still couldn't find a single advantage.

For the first time in millennia, a devil had made a truly *fair* deal.

Malachar was furious. And impressed.

He offered Vesper something the Syndicate couldn't: *power*. Real power. The ability to enforce contracts across planes. The authority to collect debts from anyone, anywhere. A position in the infernal hierarchy.

Vesper said yes.

### The Collector

For seven years, Vesper worked for Hell.

She traveled the world collecting debts. Not always souls—sometimes memories, sometimes years of life, sometimes specific moments of happiness. Devils are creative with their contracts.

She was good at it. Better than good. She found loopholes that let debtors pay early. She negotiated extensions for those who needed them. She even occasionally voided contracts entirely when the terms had been obtained through fraud.

Malachar hated her methods. But he couldn't argue with her results. Collections were up 40% since she joined.

Then came the child.

### The Breaking Point

Lily Marsden was seven years old.

Her grandmother had made a deal with Malachar fifty years ago—a desperate bargain during a famine, trading "the happiness of my bloodline" for enough food to survive the winter. Grandma Marsden died before the collection. The contract passed to her daughter. Then to her granddaughter.

Lily was the last of the Marsden line. And she was unbearably happy.

The terms were clear. The debt was real. Vesper was supposed to collect.

She looked at this seven-year-old girl—this child who laughed at butterflies and named every animal she saw and had never done anything wrong in her entire short life—and she couldn't do it.

*"The contract is void,"* Vesper told Malachar. *"Terms obtained through exploitation of emergency circumstances. Grandmother Marsden didn't have meaningful choice."*

*"The contract is VALID,"* Malachar screamed. *"You don't get to decide what's fair. The Law decides. The CONTRACT decides."*

*"Then the Law is wrong."*

She tore up the contract. Lily Marsden kept her happiness.

And Vesper became the most wanted creature in the Nine Hells.

### Why She Enters

The Sanctum's barriers work both ways. Demons cannot enter. Devils cannot reach. The infernal courts have no jurisdiction inside those walls.

If Vesper can reach the core—if she can survive long enough to become the Warden—she becomes *untouchable*. The barriers will shield her forever. Malachar will spend eternity screaming at a door he cannot open.

It's not just sanctuary. It's victory. The first time she'll have won something for *herself*, rather than for clients or masters.

But the Sanctum has prices too. Everything does. And Vesper knows better than anyone: the best deals are the ones where you know exactly what you're paying.

## Character Arc

### Act 1: The Game Recognizes Game

The Sanctum's economy fascinates Vesper. Everything here is transactional. Souls for power. Memory for existence. Identity for... what?

She realizes: the Hollow God operates on contract logic. It consumes identities because that's the *payment* for something. But payment for what? What does the void receive in return?

Nothing.

The Hollow God is the ultimate bad deal. Pure loss. No return. No benefit to either party.

For the first time in her life, Vesper sees a contract she might be able to *improve*.

**Theme:** Even cosmic horrors follow rules.

### Act 2: Malachar's Reach

Malachar is at the barriers. Screaming.

She can hear him in the Flooded Depths—his voice carries through the thinnest points in the Sanctum's walls. He's been following her since she entered, waiting for her to die, waiting for her protection to fail.

*"YOU THINK WALLS CAN SAVE YOU? I HAVE ETERNITY. I HAVE PATIENCE. THE MOMENT YOU STEP OUTSIDE—"*

*"Then I won't step outside,"* Vesper thinks. *"Problem solved."*

But Malachar mentions something else. Lily Marsden has been sick. Not devil-curse sick—naturally sick. The kind of sick that costs money to fix.

*"She'll die without treatment. And her mother can't afford it. Do you want me to... make an offer?"*

He's lying. Or he's not. Vesper can't tell from here.

**Theme:** Freedom from old contracts doesn't mean freedom from conscience.

### Act 3: The Final Negotiation

The Hollow God is the worst negotiator Vesper has ever seen.

It takes everything. It gives nothing. It operates purely on loss, never on exchange. Three thousand years of consuming identities, and it's never once offered anything in return.

No wonder it's empty. It's never *received* anything freely given.

Vesper has an idea. A terrible, brilliant, possibly suicidal idea.

What if she *negotiated* with the Hollow God?

Not fighting it. Not fleeing it. *Dealing* with it.

*"You want identity. I can see that. You consume them because you're trying to become something. Right?"*

*"I... I don't know what I want. I just hunger."*

*"Yeah. That's because you've never gotten what you actually need. You've been stealing identities. You've never been* given *one."*

*"Given?"*

*"Free exchange. No coercion. No consumption. A gift."*

*"...Why would anyone give me anything?"*

*"Because that's how real deals work. Both parties gain."*

She can't defeat the Hollow God. But she might be able to *reform* it.

**Theme:** The greatest victory is making enemies into partners.

## Personality

Vesper is **charming** in a way that makes you check your pockets afterward.

She smiles easily. She laughs readily. She makes you feel like you're her favorite person in any room. All of it is calculated—and all of it is genuine. Vesper learned early that being liked was survival. Now it's just who she is.

But there's something real underneath. Vesper refused to collect from a child. She broke her own rules. She damned herself (literally) for someone she'd just met.

She tries to pretend it was strategic. It wasn't. It was *moral*. And that terrifies her.

Because if Vesper Coin has morals, then all those other collections—all those debts she *did* collect—were *choices*. She could have refused before. She didn't.

She's not sure if she's seeking redemption or running from guilt. Maybe both.

### Voice Examples

**Combat Start:** "Let's negotiate terms. I attack you, you try not to die."

**Collecting Favor:** "Information is currency. Currency is power. Power is survival."

**Paying a Price:** "Every deal has costs. I knew that going in."

**Taking Damage:** "Noted. Adding that to your tab."

**Killing Blow:** "Contract terminated. Permanently."

**Low HP:** "Don't worry. I've operated at a deficit before."

**Victory:** "Pleasure doing business. Let's never meet again."

## Warden Dialogue (Class-Specific)

### First Meeting
> "A bargainer. No—a *good* bargainer. I can smell it on you. You understand fair exchange."
>
> "Malachar is screaming at my walls. Has been since you entered. He really wants you dead."
>
> "Whatever you did to him... I approve."

### After Act 1 Boss
> "Lord Vexal made bargains too. For glory. For immortality. But he never understood the terms."
>
> "You would have. You would have seen the fine print. 'Immortality' doesn't specify 'pleasant immortality.'"
>
> "The devil is in the details. Literally, in your case."

### Entering Act 2
> "Aldric made the greatest bargain in this place's history. His soul for three thousand children."
>
> "No fine print. No loopholes. Pure exchange."
>
> "That's what good deals look like. Both parties get what they actually need."

### Entering Act 3
> "The Hollow God doesn't bargain. It only takes."
>
> "That's why it's always hungry. You can't fill a void with theft."
>
> "Maybe you can teach it something. Maybe you can't. But if anyone could make a deal with the nothing... it would be someone like you."

## Boss Dialogue Integration

### The Bonelord (Act 1)

**Phase 1:**
Vexal: *"You stink of brimstone. Another devil's toy."*

Vesper: *"Toy? I wrote the contracts. I was nobody's toy."*

Vexal: *"Everyone is someone's toy. Even kings. Even devils."*

**Phase 2:**
Vexal: *"What did you bargain for? Power? Wealth? Immortality?"*

Vesper: *"Nothing for myself. That was the problem."*

Vexal: *"Then you're a fool. The only bargains worth making are selfish ones."*

Vesper: *"Says the skeleton."*

**Phase 3:**
Vexal: *"I bargained for glory. I received eternity. WHERE IS THE GLORY IN THIS?"*

Vesper: *"You should have read the terms more carefully."*

### The Drowned King (Act 2)

**Phase 1:**
Aldric: *"I know you. Your kind. You deal in souls."*

Vesper: *"I did. Past tense."*

Aldric: *"Can anyone truly stop? The hunger for profit doesn't fade."*

**Phase 2:**
Aldric: *"I made a bargain. My soul for their lives. Was it fair?"*

Vesper: *"...Yes. It was. You knew exactly what you were paying."*

Aldric: *"Then why does it still hurt?"*

Vesper: *"Because fair doesn't mean painless. It just means honest."*

**Phase 3:**
Aldric: *"Make me an offer. Any offer. I'm so tired. What would you take to end this?"*

Vesper: *"Nothing. This one's free."*

### The Hollow God (Act 3)

**Phase 1:**
Hollow God: *"A bargainer. You trade in identity. You understand value."*

Vesper: *"Better than you. You've been running a deficit for three thousand years."*

Hollow God: *"I don't understand."*

Vesper: *"You only take. You never give. That's not commerce—that's theft."*

**Phase 2:**
Hollow God: *"What could I give? I have nothing."*

Vesper: *"That's your problem. You could give *nothing*. Peace. Silence. An end to pain."*

Hollow God: *"People would... pay for that?"*

Vesper: *"Some people. In the right circumstances. Consensually. You've been forcing it."*

**Phase 3:**
Hollow God: *"STOP TALKING! STOP MAKING SENSE! I AM HUNGER! I AM VOID! I DON'T MAKE DEALS!"*

Vesper: *"Then you'll be hungry forever. Your choice."*

Hollow God: *"I... I don't know how to choose. I've never chosen anything."*

Vesper: *"Yeah. That's why I might be able to help you."*

## Victory/Defeat Screens

### Victory: Becoming the Warden

> The void recedes. The barriers hold. Malachar's screaming fades.
>
> Lyra stands before the throne, finally able to fade. "You did something I've never seen. You... *talked* to it."
>
> "Negotiation is what I do."
>
> "The Hollow God is listening now. Not attacking. Not consuming. *Listening*."
>
> "First step to any deal. Understand what the other party actually wants."
>
> **THE CHOICE**
>
> "If you become the Warden, you'll have eternity to... what? Reform a cosmic void?"
>
> Vesper laughs. "Do you know how long my average contract negotiation takes? Eternity might not be enough."
>
> "Malachar will never touch you here."
>
> "I know. That's... part of it. But not all."
>
> [Become the Warden]
> "I've spent my whole life making deals for other people. Maybe it's time to close one for myself."
>
> "And if I can turn the Hollow God into something that trades fairly instead of consuming blindly? That's the biggest deal in history."
>
> [Leave the Sanctum]
> "No. There's a girl outside—Lily Marsden. Malachar said she was sick."
>
> "He was probably lying."
>
> "Probably. But what if he wasn't? I broke my contract for her. I should at least check."
>
> "You'll be hunted forever."
>
> "Then I'll negotiate my way out. It's what I do."

### Defeat: Consumed by the Void

> Vesper falls. The void reaches for her.
>
> "At last. Something that understood value. Something that knew exchange."
>
> She laughs, even as she fades. "You know the funny part? You're consuming me without payment. Again. You've learned nothing."
>
> "I—what would you want? What would make this fair?"
>
> "A promise. The girl—Lily Marsden. Don't let Malachar touch her."
>
> "Why would I—"
>
> "Because you're about to consume someone who broke a devil's contract for a stranger. That's worth something. That's *rare*."
>
> The Hollow God pauses. Considers.
>
> "...Very well. The child is protected. The devil cannot have her."
>
> "Good. Then we have a deal."
>
> She fades smiling. The last bargain she ever made was her best.

## Favor/Price Mechanic: Narrative Meaning

**Favor** and **Prices** represent the economy of trust and obligation that Vesper navigates.

### Favor
Favor is accumulated goodwill—debts owed TO Vesper. Fair deals closed. Promises kept. Trust earned. The more Favor she has, the more leverage she possesses.

*"Collect Favor"* isn't greed. It's building capital. Capital that can be spent when it matters.

### Prices
Prices are the costs Vesper incurs—debts she owes. Every powerful card comes with ongoing obligations. HP drain is blood payment. Resolve tax is mental burden. Curse cards are spiritual debt.

The mechanic represents Vesper's core dilemma: power always costs. The question is whether you can manage the payments.

### The Balance
The Bargainer's gameplay is about *managing* the economy, not avoiding it. Prices aren't bad—they're expected. Favor isn't good—it's leverage. The skill is knowing when to incur debt and when to pay it off.

Just like real bargaining.

---

## Relic: Voided Contract

**Effect:** At the start of each combat, remove one random Price. Start each combat at +3 Favor.

**Flavor Text:**
> *"The contract Vesper broke to save Lily Marsden. The paper is blank now—terms voided, signatures erased."*
>
> *It still smells like brimstone. Malachar's fury is practically visible, scorched into the margins.*
>
> *But underneath the rage, barely visible: a child's drawing. A stick figure labeled "THE LADY WHO SAVED ME." Seven years old and already making art.*
>
> *Worth it.*
