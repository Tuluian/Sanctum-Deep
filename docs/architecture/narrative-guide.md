# Sanctum Ruins: Narrative Design Guide

> "The Sanctum doesn't kill the unworthy. It becomes them."

This document provides narrative context for all game content. Every card, enemy, and mechanic should reinforce the story. Players should feel meaning, nostalgia, and care—not just mechanical satisfaction.

---

## The Core Truth

**The Sanctum is a prison.** The Hollow God—an entity that consumes identity—is sealed within. The "dungeon" is not a place of treasure but a test. Those who fail don't die; they're absorbed. The enemies you fight were once heroes, pilgrims, seekers.

**The Warden is dying.** Every prison needs a jailer. When you win, you don't escape—you take the Warden's place. The dungeon "tests" you because it needs a successor. This isn't cruelty; it's necessity.

**You made a pact to enter.** No one stumbles into the Sanctum. Each class represents a different desperate bargain, a different reason to trade your old life for this chance.

---

## The Three Acts: A Journey of Identity

### Act 1: The Entrance Halls — "What You Were"
**Theme:** Memory and Loss

The halls echo with the recently consumed. Cultists who sought power. Skeletons of adventurers who kept their armor but lost their names. Zombies who remember nothing but hunger. These enemies attack reflexively—they're not malicious, just empty.

**Atmosphere:**
- Faded murals depicting hopeful pilgrims entering
- Candles that light themselves as you approach
- Whispers in languages you almost understand
- Your own footsteps echoing back... slightly delayed

**The Bonelord (Boss):** Once Lord Vexal, a legendary knight who entered seeking immortality 300 years ago. He found it—sort of. His pride was so strong he retained something of himself, but that something became twisted. He guards the entrance not to stop you, but because he forgot any other purpose. Defeating him is an act of mercy. His last words: "I was so close to escaping this place..."

---

### Act 2: The Flooded Depths — "What You Became"
**Theme:** Corruption and Bargains

These chambers hold those who survived longer before failing. Dark mages who bargained with the Hollow God. Aberrations formed from merged souls. The architecture here is grander—this was once a kingdom's stronghold, before the waters rose.

**Atmosphere:**
- Waterlogged banners of a kingdom that no longer exists
- Throne rooms filled with drowned courtiers frozen mid-bow
- Bubbles rising from the depths, each containing a scream
- The sound of a crown rolling across stone, endlessly

**The Drowned King (Boss):** King Aldric of Thalassar. His kingdom faced a plague that would kill every child under ten. He entered the Sanctum and made a pact: his soul for his kingdom's survival. The children lived. He didn't—not really. Now he guards the path to the core, still believing he's protecting his people, who exist only in his shattered memories.

His soldiers are memories made manifest. When they die, they whisper names of people who forgot them centuries ago.

**Key Dialogue:**
- Phase 1: "The kingdom... must... survive..."
- Phase 2: "I gave everything! Do you understand?"
- Phase 3: "I can't... remember their faces anymore..."
- Death: "Finally... rest..."

---

### Act 3: The Sanctum Core — "What You Must Choose"
**Theme:** Sacrifice and Purpose

The core holds the oldest failures—beings so warped they're barely recognizable as having once been human. Here, the walls pulse like flesh. The air tastes of copper and regret. The Hollow God's influence is everywhere.

**Atmosphere:**
- Reality frays at the edges—colors shift wrong
- Previous Wardens' crystallized forms line the walls
- Each crystal contains a name, a date, a single regret
- The silence is so complete you hear your own heartbeat

**The Hollow God (Final Boss):** Not a creature, but an absence. A void that hungers for identity because it has none. Fighting it means pieces of yourself are stripped away. Your cards become corrupted. Your name starts to slip.

Victory isn't about killing it—it's about refusing to be consumed. You win by asserting: "I am still here. I am still me."

**Key Dialogue:**
- Phase 1: "You carry such... weight. Let me lighten it."
- Phase 2: "Your name... I'm forgetting it already. So will you."
- Phase 3: "BECOME. NOTHING. BECOME. ME."
- On player low HP: "You're so close to peace. Just... let go."
- Death: "No... not... another... Warden..."

---

## The Five Classes: Why They Entered

### The Cleric — Faith Seeking Answers
**True Name:** Elara Dawnkeeper (suggested default, player can customize)

**Backstory:** Their god fell silent three months ago. The prayers that once healed now echo hollow. The church elders whispered of the Sanctum—rumors that it holds a fragment of divine power. They sent Elara to investigate.

The truth is worse: their god was a previous Warden who finally faded.

**Character Arc:** From faithful servant to reluctant deity. The Devotion they build isn't divine—it's self-belief. By the end, they must accept that the power they sought was always within them. Becoming the Warden means becoming what they worshipped.

**Personality:** Gentle but resolute. Speaks of "we" not "I." Heals enemies when possible, not out of naivety but conviction. Questions faith but never abandons hope.

**Card Flavor Philosophy:** Cards should reflect the journey from external faith to internal strength.
- Early cards: Reference their god directly
- Mid cards: Question, seek, doubt
- Late cards: Power comes from within

**Sample Card Flavor:**
- *Smite*: "The light doesn't come from above anymore. It comes from within."
- *Prayer of Mending*: "They taught me to ask for healing. They never said who answers."
- *Consecrate*: "Holy ground isn't found. It's made."
- *Resurrection* (Rare): "I asked my god for a miracle. The silence that answered taught me I was the miracle."

---

### The Dungeon Knight — Duty Seeking Truth
**True Name:** Ser Varren of the Sealed Gate (suggested default)

**Backstory:** The Order of the Sealed Gate has guarded the Sanctum's entrance for twelve generations. Varren's mentor, Ser Aldric (no relation to the Drowned King—or so they believe), entered fifteen years ago to investigate disappearances. He never returned.

Varren enters seeking answers. They find more than they bargained for: Ser Aldric became the Oathbroken elite enemy. Their mentor stands before them, hollow-eyed, and attacks.

**Character Arc:** From duty-bound soldier to understanding that some prisons require willing prisoners. The Order was right to guard the door—but they never understood what was truly inside. By the end, Varren must choose whether to continue the Order's mission from within.

**Personality:** Stoic, measured, speaks rarely. When they do speak, every word counts. Carries their mentor's crest on their shield. Fights with precise, economical movements—no wasted motion.

**Fortify Mechanic (Narrative):** The persistent block represents mental fortitude—they endure not through faith but sheer will. They've trained their entire life to hold the line. They didn't know the line was inside them.

**Sample Card Flavor:**
- *Sword Strike*: "The Order taught me this on my first day. Ser Aldric corrected my grip."
- *Raise Shield*: "Hold. Endure. Remain."
- *Bulwark Stance*: "The wall does not bend. The wall does not break. I am the wall."
- *Fortify*: "The Order taught us to hold the line. They didn't mention we'd become it."
- *Unbreakable* (Rare): "They broke my sword. They broke my armor. They could not break me."

---

### The Diabolist — Ambition Seeking Escape
**True Name:** Mordecai Ashworth (suggested default)

**Backstory:** Mordecai was dying. A wasting curse, payment for dabblings in forbidden magic. A devil named Xan'thrax offered a bargain: enter the Sanctum, bring back a fragment of the Hollow God, and the curse lifts. The devil wants to become a new Hollow God—one it controls.

What Mordecai didn't know: Xan'thrax cannot enter the Sanctum. The pact was a trap. Either Mordecai retrieves the fragment (empowering a devil to cosmic status) or dies trying (voiding the debt, leaving the curse uncured).

**Character Arc:** From desperate bargainer to someone who refuses to be anyone's pawn. The Contracts mechanic represents layers of debt—but debt can be repaid... or renegotiated. By the end, Mordecai must choose: complete the contract (dooming the world), betray Xan'thrax (accepting death), or find a third option: become the Warden and seal the devil out permanently.

**Personality:** Sardonic, theatrical, hides fear behind wit. Makes dark jokes about their own mortality. Secretly terrified—not of death, but of having lived a wasted life. The performative confidence cracks in quieter moments.

**Soul Debt (Narrative):** Not just a counter—it's the literal number of souls consumed to power your magic. At 10+, you hear Xan'thrax's whispers. At 20+, the whispers become commands.

**Sample Card Flavor:**
- *Soul Rend*: "The screaming stops eventually. You stop hearing it before that."
- *Dark Bargain*: "The contract specified 'a life.' It didn't specify whose."
- *Blood Pact*: "Xan'thrax promised power. He didn't mention the interest rate."
- *Hellfire*: "I learned this from a devil. He learned it from something worse."
- *Infernal Contract* (Rare): "Sign here, here, and here. Don't read the fine print—it reads you."

---

### The Oathsworn — Justice Seeking Destruction
**True Name:** Sister Callista of the Burning Truth (suggested default)

**Backstory:** The Order of the Burning Truth believes the Warden system is corrupt. Why should anyone sacrifice themselves eternally? Why should this horror-prison be *maintained* instead of destroyed? Sister Callista has trained her entire life for one mission: enter the Sanctum, destroy the seal, and end the cycle forever.

What she doesn't know: without the Warden, the Hollow God escapes. The Order's righteous crusade would release cosmic horror.

**Character Arc:** From zealot to someone who understands that some systems, however unjust, exist for reasons. The Vows mechanic represents her rigid worldview—powerful but inflexible. Breaking a Vow isn't just mechanical; it's the crack forming in her certainty.

**Personality:** Intense, absolutely convinced of her righteousness. Speaks in scripture quotes and absolute statements. As her certainty cracks, vulnerability shows through. She entered ready to die; she wasn't ready to be wrong.

**Vow Breaking (Narrative):** Breaking a Vow means her beliefs failed. The damage taken isn't physical—it's existential. Each break is: "The Order lied. This truth burns."

**Sample Card Flavor:**
- *Righteous Strike*: "Strike true and strike once. Hesitation is heresy."
- *Oath of Valor*: "My vows were meant to protect. Now they only sharpen my sword."
- *Judgment*: "The Order taught us to judge. They didn't mention we'd be judged in turn."
- *Sacred Vow* (Rare): "I swore to destroy this place. I didn't swear to understand it first. Perhaps I should have."

---

### The Fey-Touched — Chaos Seeking Freedom
**True Name:** Wren (no surname—the fey don't use them)

**Backstory:** Wren didn't choose to enter. A fey lord named Oberon lost a bet to the Warden—yes, even dying Wardens play games—and the price was a mortal champion. Wren was sleeping in a fairy ring (never do this) and woke up in the Sanctum.

The catch: Oberon wants Wren to fail. A soul consumed by the Hollow God means the debt is voided. Every "gift" the fey lord sends is secretly sabotage.

**Character Arc:** From unwilling pawn to someone who embraces chaos on their own terms. The Whimsy mechanic represents Oberon's interference—but interference can be turned against its source. By the end, Wren must choose: escape the Sanctum (returning to Oberon's service), become the Warden (gaining power over the fey who wronged them), or find the true ending (where Oberon is bound to serve *them*).

**Personality:** Sarcastic, flippant, refuses to take anything seriously—because taking things seriously means admitting they're scared. Uses humor as armor. Underneath: a fierce desire to be the author of their own story, not a piece in someone else's game.

**Luck (Narrative):** Luck represents brief moments when Oberon is distracted. High Luck means: "He's not watching—act now."

**Sample Card Flavor:**
- *Fey Bolt*: "Aim is a mortal concern. The bolt knows where it wants to go."
- *Glamour*: "Reality is a suggestion. A polite one, but still."
- *Pixie's Gift*: "The fey call it a gift. They have a strange sense of humor."
- *Trickster's Trade*: "Fair trades are boring. Unfair trades are educational."
- *Wild Magic* (Rare): "Oberon's watching. Give him a show."

## Enemy Design: They Were People

Every enemy should feel like a tragedy, not just a target. Brief text before combat reminds players who they're fighting.

### Naming Convention
- **Common enemies:** Generic titles representing what they became
- **Elite enemies:** Actual names and entry dates
- **Bosses:** Full names, titles, and backstory revealed through dialogue

### Act 1 Common Enemies

| Enemy | Former Self | Death Quote |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Forgotten Pilgrim** (Skeleton) | Adventurer who came seeking glory | "I wrote letters home... who were they to?" |
| **Consumed Delver** (Zombie) | Healer who came to help | "I had medicine... it wasn't enough..." |
| **Hollow Initiate** (Cultist) | Seeker who came willingly | "The void promised understanding... I understand now..." |
| **Oathbroken** (Haunted Armor) | Knight of the Drowned King's guard | "My liege... I'm sorry I failed you..." |
| **Ghoul** | Survivor who ate the others | *No quote—they've forgotten speech* |
| **Bone Archer** | Scout who went ahead of their party | "I signaled them to run... did they make it?" |
| **Shade** | Mage who tried to understand the void | "I saw what's behind reality. I wish I hadn't." |
| **Acolyte** | True believer in the Hollow God | "To serve emptiness is still to serve." |

### Act 1 Elite Enemies

| Enemy | Entry | Backstory |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Varric, the Unburied** (Tomb Guardian) | Entered 47 years ago | "Came to prove he was worthy of his family name. Found only darkness." |
| **High Cultist Mira** | Entered 12 years ago | "Was a healer. Her child died. She entered seeking resurrection. Found only service." |

### Act 2 Enemies
*Coming soon - themes of corruption and bargains*

### Act 3 Enemies
*Coming soon - themes of annihilation and identity*

## The Warden: Guide and Goal

The Warden appears throughout the run, first as mysterious guide, eventually as the goal itself.

### Warden Dialogue Triggers

**First Combat:**
"Another soul enters. Perhaps you'll last longer than the others."

**First Elite:**
"You have strength. But strength wasn't enough for me either. What else do you carry?"

**First Boss (Bonelord):**
"Lord Vexal was the first to answer my call, centuries ago. He was a proud man. Pride is not always a sin."

**Act 2 Entry:**
"The Drowned King awaits. He was my friend once. End his suffering."

**Act 2 Boss (Drowned King):**
"Aldric sacrificed everything for love. Remember that, when you face your own choice."

**Act 3 Entry:**
"I cannot hold much longer. The void hungers. You must choose what you will become."

**Final Boss (Hollow God):**
"This is what we guard against. This is why I need you. This is why the Sanctum exists."

### Warden Dialogue by Class

**To the Cleric:**
- "Ah, a child of faith. Your god was once like me. Bound. Watching. Hoping."
- "The light you seek is not outside. It never was."

**To the Dungeon Knight:**
- "The Order of the Sealed Gate. Your people have guarded my prison for generations."
- "Ser Aldric... I remember him. He asked about you before the end."

**To the Diabolist:**
- "You reek of brimstone and bad bargains. The devil cannot enter here—but he's watching."
- "Your contractor lies. But you knew that, didn't you?"

**To the Oathsworn:**
- "You came to destroy me. I do not blame you. The truth burns, doesn't it?"
- "The Order of the Burning Truth means well. They simply do not understand what they would release."

**To the Fey-Touched:**
- "Oberon's debt. I remember. He cheats at dice, you know."
- "The fey lord wants you to fail. I want you to spite him."

## Card Naming Conventions

Cards should feel like they belong to a living world, not a mechanical system.

### Guidelines

1. **Avoid generic names:** "Strike," "Defend," "Heal" tell the player nothing about the world
2. **Imply history:** A card called "Oathkeeper's Edge" suggests a story
3. **Match class identity:** Cleric cards are prayers, Knight cards are techniques, Diabolist cards are contracts
4. **Rare cards tell stories:** The most powerful cards should have the most evocative names

### Examples by Class

| Generic | Cleric | Knight | Diabolist | Oathsworn | Fey-Touched |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Strike | Smite | Disciplined Cut | Soul Rend | Righteous Strike | Capricious Bolt |
| Block | Shield of Faith | Raise the Wall | Dark Bargain | Sacred Guard | Glamour Veil |
| Heal | Mending Prayer | Second Wind | Blood Price | Martyr's Comfort | Fey Blessing |
| Draw | Inspired Word | Tactical Assessment | Whispered Secrets | Vow of Knowledge | Chaos Glimpse |
| Power | Blessing | Iron Resolve | Infernal Contract | Sacred Oath | Wild Attunement |

---

## Environmental Lore

Each act should contain environmental details that reward observation. The goal is **silent storytelling**—players who rush through miss it, players who pause are rewarded with worldbuilding.

---

### Act 1: Entrance Halls — "What Was Lost"

**Visual Theme:** Faded grandeur. A place that was once welcoming, now frozen in decay.

**Murals:** Faded paintings showing hopeful pilgrims entering the Sanctum. Some figures in the murals match enemy designs—the Forgotten Pilgrims were once depicted as heroes.

*Examples:*
- A mural of a young knight with a red banner (Lord Vexal, before)
- A painting of pilgrims being blessed by a robed figure (a previous Warden)
- A depiction of the Sanctum's gates, open and inviting, with the caption: "All Are Welcome Who Seek Truth"

**Inscriptions (Found on walls, floors, carved desperately):**
| Location | Inscription | Who Wrote It |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Entry arch | *"Enter seeking, leave becoming"* | Official motto |
| First rest room | *"I came for gold. I found something else."* | Anonymous |
| Near a skeleton cluster | *"We should have turned back. We should have—"* | Unfinished |
| Scratched into floor | *"DAY 7. THE WALLS MOVE. I'M NOT IMAGINING IT."* | Lost delver |
| Near elite chamber | *"For Varric. For House Korrath."* | His brothers |

**Environmental Details:**
- **Campsites:** Abandoned, with personal effects. Journals (unreadable), rings, dried flowers, sketches of loved ones.
- **A child's toy:** Near a skeleton wearing adult armor. The parent brought a reminder. It didn't help.
- **Candles that still burn:** Who lights them? (Answer: The Warden. It's how they express care.)
- **Sound design:** Distant whispers. Echoes of conversations that happened centuries ago. Your own footsteps, slightly delayed.

**Class-Specific Environmental Details:**
- **Cleric:** Prayer beads scattered near a collapsed altar. The prayers carved into the stone are in your deity's language.
- **Knight:** Order of the Sealed Gate insignias on some skeletons. These were your predecessors.

---

### Act 2: Flooded Depths — "What Was Sacrificed"

**Visual Theme:** Drowned beauty. A palace underwater, preserved and rotting simultaneously.

**Banners:** Waterlogged standards of Thalassar, the Drowned King's kingdom. The crest: a crowned wave. They float gently in currents that shouldn't exist.

**The Queen's Story (Environmental Narrative):**
Throughout Act 2, players piece together Elara's story—the Drowned King's queen who watched him leave:

*Room 1:* A portrait of the royal couple. Her face is scratched out—by him, unable to bear the memory.

*Room 2:* Letters, waterlogged but legible: *"You don't have to do this. We can find another way."* —Elara

*Room 3:* His response, never sent: *"There is no other way. The children will die. I will not let that happen. Forgive me. Forget me."*

*Throne Room:* "For Elara" carved into the throne. He never forgot. He just... couldn't remember why he remembered.

**Inscriptions:**
| Location | Inscription | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Palace gates | *"Thalassar Endures"* | It doesn't, but he thinks it does |
| Nursery door | *"The children are safe. The children are safe."* | Written a thousand times |
| Flooded ballroom | *"We danced here once."* | Aldric's handwriting |
| Before boss room | *"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."* | Whose voice? Maybe the Warden's |

**Environmental Details:**
- **Drowned courtiers:** Frozen mid-bow, eyes open. They died honoring their king. They're still honoring him.
- **The Queen's Crown:** On a pillow, untouched by water. Protected. He couldn't bear to see it damaged.
- **Nursery:** Toys still arranged. The children he saved never returned to this room. They grew up, had children of their own, and eventually forgot there was ever a King Aldric. Their descendants don't even remember Thalassar.
- **Sound design:** The sound of water dripping. Distant sobbing. A lullaby hummed in a voice that might be the King's.

**The Flood Mechanic (Narrative):**
The rising water isn't just a game mechanic—it's the Drowned King's grief made manifest. The deeper you go, the higher it rises. He's drowning in memory, and he's taking you with him.

---

### Act 3: Sanctum Core — "What Must Be Chosen"

**Visual Theme:** Reality breaking. A place between places. The architecture doesn't obey rules.

**Crystallized Wardens:** Previous Wardens' forms line the walls. They're not dead—they're preserved. Each crystal contains:

| Name | Years Served | Regret |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Theron the Builder | 1,247 years | *"I never said goodbye."* |
| Mara of the Dawn | 892 years | *"I told him I didn't love him. It was a lie."* |
| Kael the Reluctant | 634 years | *"I should have fought harder to stay human."* |
| The Nameless One | 2,103 years | *"I forgot my own name. I was so afraid of the God that I forgot myself."* |
| Ser Aldric III | 67 years | *"I wasn't ready. I'm still not ready."* |
| The Warden Before | 347 years | *"I should have trained my successor better."* |

The current Warden's crystal is forming. It's almost complete. Time is running out.

**Inscriptions:**
| Location | Inscription | Effect on Reader |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Core entrance | *"Here lies purpose. Here ends choice."* | Stark warning |
| Warden memorial | *"We chose this. Remember that. We chose."* | Justification or comfort? |
| Hollow God's chamber | *"The void hungers. We hunger back."* | Defiance |
| Final hallway | Names—hundreds, carved by those who wanted to be remembered | Players can add their character's name post-game |

**Environmental Details:**
- **Walls that pulse:** Like flesh. Like breath. The Sanctum is alive—it's the Warden's body, extended.
- **Colors that shift:** Blue bleeds into sounds you can taste. Reality is negotiable here.
- **Your reflection:** In surfaces, but the reflection blinks first. Moves wrong. Smiles when you don't.
- **Sound design:** Silence. Complete silence. Then: *"[Player's character name]... come home."*

**The Hollow God's Influence:**
As you progress through Act 3, the UI begins to degrade:
- Card names become harder to read (corruption)
- Your character portrait shifts subtly
- The Warden's voice gets quieter; another voice gets louder

---

### Environmental Storytelling Guidelines for Developers

1. **Show, don't tell.** A child's toy says more than a paragraph of exposition.

2. **Reward observation.** Players who rush miss the story. Players who pause find it.

3. **Connect to gameplay.** The Drowned King's Flood mechanic is his grief. The Bonelord's summons are his inability to let go of command.

4. **Use silence.** A room with nothing in it, after rooms full of detail, is terrifying.

5. **Class-specific details.** If the Knight is playing, show Order insignias. If the Cleric is playing, show religious artifacts. Make every class feel like they belong to this world.

6. **Recurrence.** Details in Act 1 should pay off in Act 3. The murals show Wardens; in Act 3, you see those same Wardens crystallized. The child's toy in Act 1 echoes the nursery in Act 2.

7. **Player contribution.** After beating the game, let players carve their character's name on the final wall. Every run adds to the memorial.

---

## Death & Failure

When players die, they should feel something beyond frustration.

**Death Screen Text (Rotates):**
- "The Sanctum rejected you. The mark remains. Return."
- "You are expelled—not destroyed. The dungeon wants you worthy, not consumed."
- "The Warden catches you at the threshold: 'Not yet. Rise again.'"
- "You see faces in the void. Some of them are your own failed runs."

**Class-Specific Death:**
- Cleric: "Your faith wavers, but does not break. Return when you remember why you believe."
- Knight: "The wall cracked. Rebuild it."
- Diabolist: "Xan'thrax laughs. You'll give him nothing to laugh about next time."
- Oathsworn: "Your vows were not enough. Perhaps they need reforging."
- Fey-Touched: "Oberon expected this. Disappoint him."

---

## Victory & The Choice

Upon defeating the Hollow God:

**The Warden's Final Words:**
"It is done. The void recedes—for now. My time has ended. The Sanctum needs a guardian.

You have proven yourself. You have seen what we protect the world from. Now... the choice is yours."

### Option A: Become the Warden
"Take up the mantle. Guard the Sanctum for eternity. Others will come. Most will fail. But someday—perhaps—one will be worthy to replace you. As you have replaced me."

**Epilogue Text (Class-Specific):**
- Cleric: "They prayed for answers. They became the answer."
- Knight: "The Order of the Sealed Gate still guards the door. They do not know their Knight guards from within."
- Diabolist: "Xan'thrax rages at his prison's edge. Mordecai smiles. The contract was never completed—but neither was it broken."
- Oathsworn: "The Order of the Burning Truth still seeks to destroy the Sanctum. Sister Callista prays they never succeed."
- Fey-Touched: "Oberon's debt is paid—in a way he never expected. Wren waves from the other side of a seal the fey lord can never cross."

### Option B: Destroy the Seal (Requires All 5 Classes Completed)
"End the cycle. Free us all—even me. Face the consequences... together."

*This triggers the True Ending content.*

---

## Implementation Notes for Developers

1. **Every enemy deserves flavor text.** Even if it's one line. Players remember the skeleton that whispered "I wrote letters home" far longer than the one that just dealt 6 damage.

2. **Card names matter more than you think.** A player will see "Smite" hundreds of times. "The Light That Burns From Within" tells a story.

3. **The Warden is your narrator.** Use them sparingly but consistently. Every appearance should reveal something.

4. **Death is part of the story.** Don't just say "You Died." The Sanctum has a reason for letting you try again.

5. **Silence is powerful.** Not every moment needs dialogue. Sometimes a child's toy next to skeleton armor says more than any speech.

---

*This document is a living guide. As we develop Sanctum Ruins, we should return here to ensure every addition—every card, enemy, and line of dialogue—serves the story we're telling.*

*The question isn't just "Is this fun?" It's "Does this matter?"*
