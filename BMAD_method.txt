Install with 'npx bmad-method install'

Load analyst agent first by running 'workflow-init'

Load PM agent with 'prd' (or 'tech-spec' for small projects)

Load Architect at 'create-architecture' (10+ stories only)

Build: 
Load SM agent → Run workflows for each story → Load DEV agent → Implement

*** ALWAYS use fresh chats and fresh sessions for each workflow to avoid hallucinations and get fresh info ***

For Claude Code - How to Use
    Type Slash Command IN CLAUDE while running: 
    Start with / to see available commands
    Select Agent: Type /bmad:{agent-name} (e.g., /bmad-dev)
    Execute: Press Enter to activate that agent persona
    Examples
    /bmad:bmm:agents:dev - Activate development agent - The DEV agent will implement the story
    /bmad:bmm:agents:architect - Activate architect agent
    /bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story - Execute dev-story workflow

    Do *help for available things to do with any agent:
    /analyst - for analyst
        Then you can talk to it like usual.
    /architect - for architect

To start claude code, use 'claude' from within project folder
    If claude isn't ready in PATH, use
        & "C:\Users\C\.local\bin\claude.exe"
    
    Launch claude, then go to the agent you need.
    /dev  - will take you to the developer role
        This role will automatically read errors and fix right away, rather than copy/pasting.

    UX-Designer will help with the UI side 

    3.1 Initialize Sprint Planning
        Start a new chat with the SM (Scrum Master) agent
        Wait for the menu to appear
        Tell the agent: "Run sprint-planning"
        This creates your sprint-status.yaml file that tracks all epics and stories

    For each subsequent story, repeat the cycle using fresh chats for each workflow:
        New chat → SM agent → "Run create-story"
        New chat → DEV agent → "Run dev-story"
        New chat → DEV agent → "Run code-review" (optional but always super highly recommended!!!!!)
